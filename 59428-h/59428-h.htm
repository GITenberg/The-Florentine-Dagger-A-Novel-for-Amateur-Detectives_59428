<h3>WALLACE SMITH&rsquo;S ILLUSTRATIONS</h3>
<p>The five illustrations contained in the following
pages, and the jacket design, are the work of the
new phenomenal black and white artist, Wallace
Smith. In making the drawings Mr. Smith chose
to illustrate the spirit of the text rather than its
letter. The result is this series of Renaissance
pictures whose dark opulence curiously interprets
the moods of the story&rsquo;s hero, Prince Julien
de Medici&mdash;of Broadway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Containing a nervous cavalier with frightened eyes&mdash;Introducing
a mysterious and puritanical satyr&mdash;And
discussing the tired ghosts that haunted the heart of
Julien De Medici.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the firelight the face of Julien De Medici
appeared like a gray and scarlet mask of ennui.
Oblivious of the ornamental room with its pattern
of books, statues and tapestries, he sat stiffly in
the carved wooden chair and stared at the burning
logs. He was waiting for his host, Victor Ballau.</p>
<p>Except for the crackling of the burning wood,
the room was still. Cowled shadows reared witch-like
shapes across the walls and ceiling.</p>
<p>It was night outside. Wind quarreled with the
stone buildings. Removing his eyes reluctantly
from the burning logs, De Medici glanced at the
darkness of the empty room. He studied the shadows
with frightened eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>He was a curious man of thirty. An aristocratic
ugliness marked his face. The long, thin nose, the
high cheek-bones, the wide, inanimate mouth and
the green-tinted skin gave him a lithographic
rather than human air. His black hair was cut
in a straight line across his forehead. He wore it
unparted in such a manner that it made an almost
square frame for the elongated rigidity of his
face.</p>
<p>A striking and bizarre figure, poised, precise
and seemingly of another world, he lived chiefly
in his eyes. They were narrow and black, symmetrical
to a point of artificiality. But under the
parenthesis of the brows lived a startling man.</p>
<p>From the carved chair before the burning logs,
De Medici studied the shadows. He disliked darkness
and empty rooms. Shadows frightened him.
Opened doors chilled him. Yet his immobile face
smiled derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled again as if amused at the emotion
disturbing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; he continued to himself. His eyes
were on the opened door in the shadows at the end
of the room. &ldquo;Ghosts walk around inside me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he fell to thinking of an old subject&mdash;of the
ghosts that prowled the mysterious corridors of
his soul.... De Medici&mdash;ah, what a name! A
sarcophagus of evil....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>He recalled with a shudder the excitement of the
critics who had written about the opening of his
play at Victor Ballau&rsquo;s theater two weeks ago.
One of them in particular had given him a bad
hour. A discerning fellow.... He remembered
the critic&rsquo;s phrases:</p>
<p>&ldquo;... and now a De Medici turned dramatist.
What a name to conjure with! One needs no
genealogical chart to assure one that here in
Julien De Medici writing plays for Broadway is
a descendant of those monstrous and evil adventurers
whose villainies once illumined the courts
of Europe....&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici smiled at the memory of the words....
A bit redundant and in the grand style
affected by romantically hungry puritans writing
for the press.... He continued recalling the
review:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For here again is the De Medici touch. Prince
Julien, who witnessed the premier of his first
drama&mdash;&lsquo;The Dead Flower&rsquo;&mdash;is a gentleman of
exemplary habits and enviable charm. But in this
play to which he has signed his name lives again
the sardonic evil which once made empire builders
of his family. A dreadful humor pervades this
amazing work. Its characters are etched with a
Satanic deftness refreshingly new&mdash;for the stage....
Prince Julien of Broadway has borrowed the
soul of his great-great-great-grandmother, with
which to write his first drama....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The burning logs exploded sharply. De Medici
sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking swiftly across the shadowed room he
shut the thing he fancied had frightened him.
Yes, opened doors in a dark room, even a lighted
room, always chilled him. They reminded him
vaguely of something&mdash;of winding corridors, of
hidden things waiting beyond them. He would sit,
slowly terrified, watching an opened doorway,
as if awaiting something, as if straining to catch
a sound of clanking and wailing....</p>
<p>His earliest memories were those of fears.
Windows, silences, doorways, darknesses, lights
far away, candle-light in a mirror, winds howling,
hidden noises&mdash;these were things of which he
had been in terror as a boy.</p>
<p>It had been that way with his father, the Prince
Julien of the Paris ateliers&mdash;an indifferent artist,
a violent-tempered, black-haired man who had
died at forty, his name a byword even to the
decadent aristocracy that postured futilely among
the memories of France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Years after his death De Medici understood the
tragedy of the man who had been his father. Rake
and scoundrel, he had died raving in drink. A
memory of debauches and black deeds had survived
him. But as he grew older the De Medici
son understood. These nightmares that bloomed
in the recesses of his own thought, these terrors
that animated the depths of his nature, had been
his father&rsquo;s legacy as well as his own. And, despairing
of the ghosts whose whisperings darkened
his life, the elder Prince Julien had fled.
Drink, women, excesses&mdash;scenes of glaring lights
and crazed laughter&mdash;these had been hiding-places.
The notorious De Medici of the Paris &rsquo;90&rsquo;s had
been no more than a frightened refugee fleeing an
inheritance.</p>
<p>Left alone in the care of a senile uncle, the boy
Julien had stumbled upon a different direction for
flight&mdash;literature. He had come into his estate
at fifteen. At eighteen he had chosen America.
France was too familiar. Its ancient roads, the
dark corners of Paris, the very air he breathed
haunted and frightened him.</p>
<p>Now, after twelve years, he had matured into a
nervously brilliant man, engagingly cynical, egoistic
as a child and subtle-minded as a Jesuit.
Among his friends he was regarded with deference.
His name, his manner, his genius combined
with his wealth attired him in an unassailable
superiority. They found him, however, neither
arrogant nor perverse, despite the startling and
often horrible plots and ideas which came from his
pen. None, not even his few intimates, had ever
intruded upon his secret, had ever glimpsed
behind the charming and stenciled smile of Prince
Julien, the &ldquo;Borgian&rdquo; ghosts that pantomimed in
his soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The offending door closed, De Medici returned
to his chair. He yearned to turn on the lights of
the room. With the cheerful glare of the electric
bulbs the dim terrors assailing him would vanish.
But, as always, he treated himself to this discipline&mdash;a
refusal to humor the senseless fears of
his nerves. He folded his hands and smiled,
regretting his action in closing the door.</p>
<p>A step in the corridor leading to the room lifted
the tension under which he sat. Victor Ballau at
last. Yet he waited, apprehensive, as the step
approached, as the door slowly opened. With the
familiar figure of his friend standing in the far
glow of the fire, however, De Medici&rsquo;s nervousness
vanished.</p>
<p>He stood up to greet his host. There was no
longer hint of fears about him. His narrow eyes
smiled. His teeth glittered in the wide mouth as
he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toasting myself like a martyr at your fireplace,
Victor,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The two men shook hands. Ballau was a man
of fifty-five, gentle-spoken, restrained of manner
and, in his very bearing, a connoisseur of life.
His hair was gray. He was tall and stood erect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;You made quite a picture by the fireplace,
Julien,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gad, you get to look more and
more medieval. Florence come in yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; Ballau looked at his friend. &ldquo;Shall I
turn on some lights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicer this way,&rdquo; De Medici answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
in a soft and romantic mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballau sat down. The two lighted cigarettes.
De Medici puffed calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, smiling at his host, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
first chance I&rsquo;ve had of getting you alone in a
week. You&rsquo;re an elusive parent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballau nodded. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; murmured De Medici. &ldquo;A corroding
and devouring passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballau studied his cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to believe you&rsquo;re serious, Julien,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An observant father. I congratulate you,
Victor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And modest. The parent ideal! Your consent,
of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, my dear Julien, is so sudden. And then
your old-fashioned tactic of appealing to the
usually negligible parent is somewhat alarming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that you&rsquo;re her father,&rdquo; De Medici
answered, &ldquo;is a matter of secondary importance,
come to think of it. What I&rsquo;ve chiefly come for is
advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice,&rdquo; Ballau answered softly, &ldquo;is, of
course, marry the gal and live happily ever afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. But there&rsquo;s another thing. Her going
on with her acting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; the older man smiled. &ldquo;Give her
her own way. I should think it an excellent
arrangement. With &lsquo;The Dead Flower&rsquo; going
over as it is you should be able to turn out at
least one play a year and keep Madame De Medici
employed under your auspices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That being settled,&rdquo; Ballau sighed, &ldquo;we might
as well have some light&mdash;and a glass of cognac. I
walked over from the theater and I&rsquo;m rather
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici turned as the door opened. Jane, the
gaunt and hollow-eyed housekeeper, was standing
on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glasses,&rdquo; murmured Ballau.</p>
<p>The woman nodded and, with a glance at the
guest, disappeared. De Medici frowned to himself.
This was another of his obsessions&mdash;an
aversion to silent people. Servants invariably
irritated him. Their closed mouths, their waiting
eyes, their inscrutable inferiorities disturbed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute,&rdquo; Ballau announced as
the footsteps of the woman died away.</p>
<p>Alone, De Medici smiled. Phantoms no longer
disturbed him. He sat thinking of Victor Ballau.
A curious man. Almost as curious as himself, perhaps.
Debonair, prosperous, cultured. Yet something
odd about him. He had made an actress of
his daughter&mdash;not a difficult task. The luxurious
figure of the young woman intruded on his
thoughts. Vivid as a macaw, with a feline slowness
in her gesture.... &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;she
is a color I need. I grow brittle and antique. She
will enable me to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a lingering moment he contemplated the
emotions that the image of her had stirred. Tenderness,
self-amusement, and an overwhelming
loneliness. &ldquo;As if I were lost away from her,&rdquo; he
mused, &ldquo;as if I were sick and bewildered for some
place to go....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his musings returned to her father. Yes,
a curious man. A background of tapestries, rare
books, antique collections and a chattering circle
of poets, dancers, painters, connoisseurs. A
quixotic fancy for the theater, he had achieved
distinction out of his failures, producing deftly
written comedies of manners and dramas of mood
that never ran. Yet the theater with its rigmarole
of intrigue, gamble, women and craftsmanship
was another part of Ballau&rsquo;s background.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>But an exterior Ballau, he mused. There was
something else about the man, and this thing whispered
itself always to De Medici&rsquo;s sensitive
imagination. This man of the theater whose
apartment was the haunt of a Sybarite, whose
cavalierly manner was the envy of a hundred bon
vivants, was, paradoxically, a puritan. A charming
and unmalicious puritan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man of taste,&rdquo; thought De Medici, &ldquo;wealthy
and with an infatuation for beautiful things....
I&rsquo;ve seen him rave before a Titian ... yet no
women. Intrigues shadow him. Beauties pursue
him. And still he remains a baffling and graceful
Galahad where one looks with certainty for a Don
Juan. It would be hard for him to dissemble&mdash;surrounded
by so avid a pack of scandalmongers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded to himself. There was something
else about Ballau&mdash;the quality toward which
his own peculiar nature responded always with
readiness. Secrecy&mdash;veiled things that lurked
behind the smiles of men and women, furtive
lights that came to their eyes when they grew
silent ... he had felt this quality in Ballau. It
had, in fact, precipitated their comradeship.</p>
<p>His thought could place no words on it, but his
intuitions led him toward a mystery&mdash;an unknown
Ballau, a jealously guarded stranger who lived a
secret life behind the debonair and gentle exterior
of the man he knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over,&rdquo; Ballau began talking
as he re&euml;ntered the room carrying bottle and
glasses on a tray, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll supplement my advice,
Julien. Let the minor details adjust themselves.
If you&rsquo;re in love with Florence, the thing to do, I
fancy, is to tell her so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed flushed as he placed the tray on a
table. He was smiling, but De Medici noticed that
his fingers trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love,&rdquo; the older man continued, &ldquo;is a rare
and everlasting flower....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and closed his eyes. De Medici noted
the darkening pain that passed over his features.
Ballau, however, continued once more in a light
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should avoid making your proposal of marriage
to her a discussion on economics or a debate
on whether a woman&rsquo;s place is in the home ...
or on the stage. You can settle all that after you&rsquo;re
married with just as much indignation and dissatisfaction
to you both as you can before the
ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici, fascinated by the nervous hands of
the man, laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;With your permission, I&rsquo;ll deceive the young
lady and save up my debates for some future
breakfast table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a gay and worthy happiness for you and
her,&rdquo; said Ballau, raising one of the glasses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>His voice had grown soft, but his eyes, as De
Medici smiled back to him, turned away. The
young man replaced his glass and, despite himself,
felt again the curious presences that had haunted
him a half hour before ... presences that awoke
always under the influence of symbols&mdash;opened
doors, darkened windows, lights gleaming in mirrors
... and enigmatic faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; whispered itself in
his thought, and for a moment he stared fearfully
at the averted eyes of his friend. Then, recovering
himself, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go down to the theater for the performance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballau shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather read,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And, besides,
from now on I feel I&rsquo;d only be in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; De Medici smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a clever
idea for making love ... and I&rsquo;m not at all
averse to an enlarged audience....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballau smiled refusal and De Medici bowed
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you to-morrow then,&rdquo; he said, and
walked from the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Victor Ballau stood for moments alone in his
library. His eyes traveled caressingly over the
luxuries that surrounded him. Beautiful things
... beautiful things ... his eyes and fingers
invariably grew alive in their presence. Carved
chairs that had once beckoned the vivacious and
swashbuckling bodies of Florentines, Englishmen
and Castilians. Books within whose covers the
strange dreams of men had yellowed. Prints and
cabinets, hangings and trinkets all breathing an
air of romantic beginnings, survivors all of vanished
splendors and obsolete dramas. He stood
gazing around him.... The great centuries
whispered out of the ornamental litter of the room.</p>
<p>Lowering himself into the chair in which De
Medici had sat, Ballau opened a book. His eyes,
however, were unable to keep to the print. They
closed as if in revery and again the weariness
and pain that De Medici had noted, darkened his
face.</p>
<p>An hour later, Jane, gaunt and hollow-eyed,
appeared in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ballau,&rdquo; she said in a dull voice.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and stared at her in confusion.
He had been dreaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be supper after the theater
tonight?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jane,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;You can turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes, haunted and preoccupied&mdash;as furtive
and veiled as the eyes of the man who had sat in
the chair before him&mdash;followed the slow-moving
figure of the housekeeper as she walked out of the
doorway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE VEILED APHRODITE</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which a lady of barbaric eyes smiles, sighs, and weeps&mdash;In
which Eros obliges with a saxophone solo&mdash;A
morning of golden shadows and an off-stage pizzicato.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New York on a spring morning.... A leap of
windows toward a gay sky, a carnival of windows,
windows fluttering like silver pennants, unwinding
in checkerboards and domino lines. A deluge
of signs, a sweep of acrobatic advertisements, a
circus of roof tops and a fanfare of stone, the city
flings itself into a glittering panorama. It stands
in bewildered pantomime. Gigantic and amazing,
it hovers like an inverted abyss over a
wavering pavement of hats.</p>
<p>De Medici turned his eyes from the trumpeting
geometries of the skyscrapers and looked at the
young woman beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re an intrusion,&rdquo; he said close to her. The
crowds drifted tenaciously around them. &ldquo;Paolo
and Francesca,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;murmuring in Bedlam.
Can&rsquo;t we go somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His lean face regarded her dreamily as she
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning is wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;The morning is a nuisance,&rdquo; he demurred.
&ldquo;But you! Beautiful&mdash;yes, your eyes are like
gardens, night gardens. Come, we&rsquo;ll go somewhere.
We&rsquo;ll take a cab. I want to talk to you in
a gentle and persuasive voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman, Florence Ballau, nodded.
De Medici stared excitedly at her. Her presence
delighted and warmed him. An amazing woman.
She wore her youth like a banner. Her gypsy face
under a blue toque stamped itself like an exotic
flower on the gray and yellow background of the
crowd. Her lips were parted, her deep eyes were
laughing darkly.</p>
<p>De Medici restrained the ecstasy that threatened
to start him stammering. She was tonic.
Her body, luxurious and vibrant under the silver
cloth of her dress, bewildered him. He was in
love. But more than that, the flamboyant life of
the girl, the gay and dominant poise of her manner,
her voice, her head, exhilarated him in a
curious way. A sense of awe came to him as he
studied for an instant the exotically masked vigor
of his companion. His own subtle and convoluted
nature prostrated itself blissfully before her vivid
dominance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to father&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; she said. He
found it difficult to object. Nevertheless he
blurted an objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why not just walk to the park and sit
down?&rdquo; she persisted.</p>
<p>De Medici shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it all!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
make love and I don&rsquo;t want a lot of fat policemen
walking up and down in front of me or a parade of
squirrel-feeding old maids staring rebukefully.
I&rsquo;ve set my mind on a cab. It&rsquo;s distinctly modern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a fearful waste of money,&rdquo; the girl smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; De Medici murmured, &ldquo;then you do love
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>They stood silently in the press of the crowds
moving down Fifth Avenue, their fingers touching.
De Medici&rsquo;s eyes grew misty. He felt curiously
at peace, as if he had escaped forever the dark
things inside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a cab, anyway,&rdquo; he said finally.
Then, as the girl raised her luminous face to him,
he grew buoyant. He looked about him with a
feeling of surprise. He had awakened from a bad
dream. Prince Julien the cynical and tormented
survivor of an evil race had vanished. Here was
an ecstatic and humorous youth making love to a
marvelous creature under the towers of a new
civilization.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a lot of speeches I&rsquo;ve always wanted
to include as a part of my first and last proposal.
We&rsquo;ll get into a cab and I&rsquo;ll propose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hailed a taxi and they entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive,&rdquo; he smiled at the chauffeur, &ldquo;slowly
and carefully, anywhere you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded, grinned, and pocketed a bill.</p>
<p>They were silent as the cab moved away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Florence at last, &ldquo;you may begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Will you marry
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You promised speeches,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind,&rdquo; he said, staring at
her. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of anything to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent again. The cab entered a
park. Turning to her, De Medici raised her hand
to his lips. His restless, burning eyes remained
on her face. He felt intoxicated. Her profile with
its parted red lips, its tiny line of white teeth, her
eyes dark and desirous as they avoided him, her
aromatic hair in black coils under the toque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I adore you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded, still avoiding his eyes.</p>
<p>Then, &ldquo;When do you want to get married?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>De Medici extricated himself from his emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he answered calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too soon. I&rsquo;ll have to tell father
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told him all about it,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded and looked fearfully at her.
She was angry. Her face had grown bright with
color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Ignoring the change in her voice, De Medici
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave me some advice. He advised me
against starting any arguments with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned her eyes to him. They were
burning and enigmatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like him. She
hides something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt miserable again. But his hand caressed
her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arguments about what?&rdquo; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this and that,&rdquo; De Medici answered smiling.
&ldquo;Never mind asking me. Let&rsquo;s save up
all the arguments for another time, when we have
nothing else to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she persisted. Then:
&ldquo;Excuse me. We&rsquo;ll tell him and have him announce
the engagement. He&rsquo;ll love that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face was again gay and dominant. De
Medici nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone him,&rdquo; he said quickly, and
tapped on the driver&rsquo;s window. The cab stopped.
Leaning out of the door, De Medici gave a vague
direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take us to a telephone,&rdquo; he said. The driver
nodded as if he appreciated the details of the situation.
They started again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julien,&rdquo; the girl exclaimed suddenly. She
was laughing. Her arms embraced the surprised
young man. He felt himself powerless for an
instant. The warmth of her body was against
him. Her lips waited intimately for his kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I adore you,&rdquo; he murmured. His arms
tightened around her and they remained embraced
as the cab rolled jerkily on.</p>
<p>The driver was talking. De Medici removed his
eyes bewilderedly from Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a telephone in that drugstore,&rdquo;
the driver repeated.</p>
<p>De Medici stepped out of the cab. Several minutes
later he returned, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parent thaws,&rdquo; he announced exuberantly.
&ldquo;We have his consent and his blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you told me you had all that in advance,&rdquo;
Florence laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he went on excitedly, &ldquo;but our talk
last night was only sort of a rehearsal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she asked as he sat down
beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to announce it tonight. Says he&rsquo;ll
summon a gathering worthy of the event.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Poor father,&rdquo; murmured Florence. Her face
had grown sad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s delightful,&rdquo; cried De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the most charming man in the world,&rdquo;
she added.</p>
<p>The driver put in an apologetic appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;d better go back to the theater,&rdquo;
Florence murmured. De Medici gave the direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she smiled as they started again,
&ldquo;from a literary point of view your proposal has
been a decided failure. I rather expected something&mdash;bizarre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me time,&rdquo; De Medici smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
improve. But why to the theater now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a matin&eacute;e today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re going to play this
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you insane? Of course I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let that bounder Mitchell make love to you
in the second act ... after this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear you&rsquo;re out of your head, Julien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You kiss him,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote the play, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hm.&rdquo; He looked at her whimsically thoughtful.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rewrite it. The kiss isn&rsquo;t necessary.
I&rsquo;ll go back and take it out. You don&rsquo;t have to
kiss him. You can just look at him&mdash;with feigned
tenderness. It&rsquo;ll be enough. How do you suppose
I&rsquo;m going to feel watching you embrace that
bounder and kiss him every night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me last week I did the part wonderfully,&rdquo;
she smiled.</p>
<p>They were in front of the theater. De Medici
held her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to have dinner with Fedya this
evening. Why don&rsquo;t you go and help father
arrange his party and call for me after the performance
tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded. He appeared to have grown
speechless. He looked with infatuated silence at
the girl. Then, with a sigh, he bowed, removing
his fedora and placing it cavalierly over his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until we meet again, beloved,&rdquo; he whispered
and, turning, walked away.</p>
<p>The girl stood where he had left her, her dark
eyes following his figure until it was lost in the
crowd. An expression of despair had come to her
face. Sorrow and uncertainty seemed to claim
her. She stepped forward as if to recall the vanishing
Julien. Then, changing her mind, she
turned and walked to the foyer. She entered the
empty theater with tears glistening in her dark
eyes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In which Julien De Medici collides with a tantalizing
corpse&mdash;In which a dagger, a candlestick, a crucifix,
and a false beard mumble incoherently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Promptly at ten o&rsquo;clock that night De Medici
walked distractedly into the stage entrance of the
Galt Theater. He had spent the day in a fever of
expectancy. A memory had followed him like an
offensive companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was crying when I went away. She stood
looking after me and wept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had watched Florence unseen by her during
the few minutes she hesitated white-faced and
weeping in front of the theater after his farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool,&rdquo; he argued with himself. &ldquo;She
was excited, overwrought. She loves me. And
perhaps there&rsquo;s something she&rsquo;ll tell me later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had offered his services to his friend Ballau
after dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing you can do except mess up
things,&rdquo; Ballau remonstrated. &ldquo;I suggest a
long, fatiguing walk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>He had smiled kindly and De Medici, unable to
dissemble his cat-like nervousness, had blurted
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find it almost impossible to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guests will be here around eleven,&rdquo; Ballau
had answered. &ldquo;Go walk around till then and
don&rsquo;t get run over or fall down any manholes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Entering the theater, De Medici looked around
the back stage quickly for a glimpse of Florence.
The wings were crowded with actors and actresses
waiting the rise of the third-act curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Miss Ballau?&rdquo; he inquired of Cort,
the stage manager.</p>
<p>Cort, a sour-looking man with the disillusions
and sophistications of his profession stamped on
his face, turned angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello!&rdquo; he said, noticing De Medici.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had the devil of a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici looked at him uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ballau had to leave,&rdquo; went on Cort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cort swore softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a time of it for the last fifteen
minutes. Miss Ballau got a telephone call at the
end of the second act. It knocked her out.
Refused to go on with the show. Said it was impossible.
And we&rsquo;ve gotten Fedya Gratin, the
understudy, to finish the last act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici listened in amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;A telephone call,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Where did
she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; growled Cort. &ldquo;All I know is
she left us in the devil of a mess ... and lit out
of here like a streak, make-up on and everything.
Wouldn&rsquo;t stop to change or listen to reason....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she say anything?&rdquo; De Medici interrupted.</p>
<p>The news had left him unaccountably sick at
heart. He made an effort to remove the fears that
were clouding his thought and to conjure up a
logical reason&mdash;a calm reason&mdash;for her departure.
He turned desperately to the manager, who had
started to move off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. What did she say on the
telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered Cort. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t get
what it was about. She said, &lsquo;Yes. Yes. Oh,
God!&rsquo; hung up and was out of here before anybody
knew what had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici dropped the man&rsquo;s arm and hurried
from the theater. In the dark alley he paused
and stared nervously about him. The darkness
frightened him. Strange glints were in his eyes.
He ran his long fingers over his forehead and
shuddered. Something had happened!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>He sat thinking as the cab hurried him to the
Ballau apartment.... &ldquo;She was crying this
morning after our ride ... there was something
curious about Ballau ... he wanted to get rid of
me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sense of relief came to him when the cab
drew up before the ornate apartment building
in Park Avenue. As he stepped out he noticed
quickly that the scene was calm, that inside the
marble lobby the stiff figure of the doorman stood&mdash;a
symbol of quietude and elegance.</p>
<p>Entering the building, he nodded to the man at
the door and walked quickly to the elevator at the
rear of the vestibule. As he approached, the filigreed
door of the self-operating elevator cage
clicked and was thrown open.</p>
<p>Florence Ballau, her eyes wide with horror,
staggered out. She stood looking wildly till her
eyes encountered De Medici. She stumbled
toward him with a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father ... father,&rdquo; her voice filled the marble
interior. &ldquo;Murdered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici held the girl in his arms. An
inexplicable calm had taken possession of him.
He regarded the scene aloofly&mdash;the hysterical
girl, the suddenly galvanized doorman, the ornamental
brass work of the marble vestibule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened,&rdquo; he said quietly to
the man as he came running forward. &ldquo;Call the
police. Send them up to Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>She moaned his name as his arms held her.
But a curious caution had entered his thought.
Half carrying her, he entered the elevator and
turned the automatic starter to Floor 5.</p>
<p>The white enameled door of the Ballau apartment
was open. De Medici supported Florence
across the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a hold of yourself,&rdquo; he whispered to her.
She raised her eyes in amazement. His voice, cool
and soft, held a tone she had never heard. Florence
pointed toward the library and watched him
walk to the door. He turned the iron knob and
stood looking into the room he had quitted a few
hours before. Before him was the famous Ballau
library converted into a curious wreck. Chairs
had been overturned, books scattered and ripped
in half, vases smashed, pictures torn from the wall
and destroyed. An air of incomprehensible and
sinister disorder hovered in the dimly lighted
chamber.</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes traveled from detail to detail.
He had sat in this room a night ago, staring at
the burning logs, his thought darkened with fears&mdash;fears
of an opened door, of the shadows that
wavered behind his chair. But now facing the
grewsome scene, his eyes lost their furtiveness.
He moved with soft, quick steps to the body of
Victor Ballau. Stretched on the floor in his black
trousers, patent leather pumps and dress shirt
lay his friend. The face was staring at the ceiling.
A red stain circled the shirt front and from
the center of the stain protruded the ornamental
hilt of a dagger. A large, black crucifix had been
placed above the wound.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="500" height="701" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>De Medici knelt beside the man. He was dead,
his eyes were open and filled with the same gentleness
which had characterized them in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murdered,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>He continued to kneel as if under the influence
of a fascination. The dagger hilt with its medieval
pattern, the black crucifix, and the inert white
face with its familiar features held the glittering
eyes of De Medici. Strange impulses stirred in
him. He shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid before death,&rdquo; his thought
was saying. &ldquo;It arouses something in me....
Murder ... murder....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind repeated the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grow calm before murder,&rdquo; he went on thinking
swiftly. &ldquo;Something grows calm inside me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fingers reached slowly toward the dagger
hilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Medici ... De Medici,&rdquo; he murmured
half aloud, and sprang to his feet. His face had
become white. His eyes burned as if with fever.</p>
<p>Florence and Jane, the housekeeper, were standing
dumbly in the doorway. De Medici stared at
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Florence shook her head and wept. Her hands
were on her cheeks and the look of horror he had
noticed as she stumbled out of the elevator had
returned. He moved quickly to her side and
placed an arm around her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police will be here in a minute,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered still in tears, her eyes centered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I came home early. I had a
headache. Jane let me in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her weeping overcame her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I opened the door,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;and saw
... this. I screamed, and Jane came running
from the kitchen. I don&rsquo;t remember anything else
until I saw you downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici caressed her shoulder and turned to
the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The woman regarded him with terrified eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;I was in the
kitchen making sandwiches and I didn&rsquo;t hear anything
until Miss Ballau screamed and I came in
here and saw him ... there....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the body and began to weep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was such a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three policemen in uniform entered. De
Medici turned to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ballau has just been murdered,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in the library.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The three men nodded and walked to the open
door of the disordered room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any other door to this place except
here?&rdquo; one of them asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said De Medici. &ldquo;The library faces on
the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fire escape.&rdquo; Florence came forward.
She pointed to the window. &ldquo;It runs past
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policeman nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take charge till the chief comes. Don&rsquo;t
allow anybody to leave the house and don&rsquo;t touch
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane, the housekeeper, sat motionless in a chair,
weeping softly, her apron to her eyes. De Medici
stood regarding the woman he loved. Her tears
had stopped. A question was in his mind. Who
had telephoned? And what had brought her home
so precipitously from the theater? But the question
remained unspoken. He stood with his arm
around her asking nothing, thinking nothing, and
watching the door.</p>
<p>It opened and a thick-set middle-aged man with
reddish hair appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Norton,&rdquo; he announced himself.</p>
<p>De Medici nodded and extended his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Julien De Medici,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Ballau
has just been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The lieutenant looked at him closely. Two
detectives followed the lieutenant into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the body?&rdquo; Norton asked. De Medici
indicated the library. The lieutenant addressed
his assistants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay here, Jim,&rdquo; he said. To the other he
added, &ldquo;And you come with me. Wait here, Mr.
De Medici&mdash;with the ladies, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;ll sit down,&rdquo; De Medici whispered.
Florence shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I could go mad,&rdquo; she muttered.</p>
<p>De Medici recalled the flushed, laughing face of
the girl who had ridden with him through the
park. Her eyes had filled him with a sense of
worship. Aloof, darkly laughing eyes. Yes, it
had been an overwhelming moment when the
arrogant gypsy loveliness of the young woman
had yielded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was I who yielded.&rdquo; He stood thinking
and regarding her averted face. &ldquo;A desire to
prostrate myself. I remember. Curious ...
curious. And now she&rsquo;s stopped weeping. When
the lieutenant came in she changed. She&rsquo;s thinking
of something. She&rsquo;s taking hold of herself.
The telephone call&mdash;the rush from the theater.
It&rsquo;ll have to be explained. Her father is dead.
But there&rsquo;s something else more important even
than her grief. Her eyes avoid me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes caught a glimpse of his fingers.
They were reddened. His thought continued:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blood on my hands. Incriminating. I reached
over and touched the dagger and stained my fingers.
Poor Ballau. And yet I felt no grief when
I kneeled there. I felt something else&mdash;as if all
this had happened once before. Yes, the body, the
dagger, the crucifix seemed familiar. I was calm.
I knew what to do. Ah, De Medici blood. Centuries
pass and it still flows unchanged in me.
Yes, why not admit it? Something exulted in me
at the sight of the room, the dim lights, the murdered
man. There was no fear, no nervousness.
But a strange feeling of familiarity. And then
a revulsion. I routed the exulting De Medici
phantoms. And now what? Trouble. A telephone
call. She&rsquo;ll tell lies. Her face is already
a lie. Stern, poised, ready to fight for something....
What a woman! Yes, I&rsquo;m more in love than
before. Her eyes are like a shrine for something
in me. They overpower me. My mind evaporates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici reached suddenly for her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;remember ...
regardless of anything&mdash;I adore you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes had passed and Lieutenant
Norton appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you,&rdquo; he said, nodding at De
Medici. He followed the detective into the room.
For a second time the amazingly disordered room
confronted him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a hasty examination,&rdquo; Norton
began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve also sent for Dr. Greer, the physician
for our squad. He&rsquo;ll be here shortly. In the
meantime we can talk over a few things. When
did this happen? I mean exactly. Do you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the detective rested on De Medici&rsquo;s
stained fingers as he spoke. De Medici held his
hand to the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly evidence,&rdquo; he answered the man&rsquo;s
unspoken question. &ldquo;I got that on my fingers
when I kneeled over the body to look at the
wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton nodded. De Medici continued and
repeated the scant information he had at his command&mdash;starting
with the appearance of Florence
Ballau in the vestibule of the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; muttered the detective. Then after a
pause, &ldquo;I see. Nothing much. Did you notice
what he has in his hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the dead man and De Medici bent
over the body. He stared with surprise. The
fingers of Victor Ballau were clutched around a
short, pointed false beard&mdash;a black Vandyke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a man, then,&rdquo; De Medici murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought it might have been a woman?&rdquo;
Norton asked quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>De Medici shrugged his shoulders. The lieutenant
appeared to forget his question and continued,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s also this thing here.&rdquo; He
indicated a heavy brass candlestick whose body
was ornamented with carved salamander figures
twining toward its mouth. It contained an unlighted
candle and stood to the left of the dead
man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that lighted when you came in first?&rdquo;
Norton asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said De Medici. &ldquo;I would have noticed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The top is still a little warm,&rdquo; the detective
explained, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll notice two or three tallow
drippings on the rug there. It was burning less
than a half hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea how the murderer
escaped?&rdquo; De Medici asked, raising his eyes to the
detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain yet,&rdquo; Norton answered. &ldquo;But
I don&rsquo;t think he has escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded slowly. The man&rsquo;s words had
started a strange panic in his brain. He waited
until his voice felt clear and then spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better search the house, then? He
may have gotten away down the fire escape. It
leads past the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Norton stared thoughtfully at the
lean-faced, cold-spoken young man. &ldquo;An odd fellow,&rdquo;
he repeated to himself, &ldquo;nervous and high-strung
as a woman. Frightened out of his wits.
And yet calm&mdash;yes, calm as a dead fish.&rdquo; Aloud
he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a search is necessary. Of course
it&rsquo;s too early to say anything definite, but my first
impression&mdash;and they&rsquo;re usually the best&mdash;is that
there&rsquo;s been no murder. Mr. Ballau committed
suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE EMPTY WEB</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which a detective weaves a theory&mdash;In which Julien
De Medici stares at a clew&mdash;In which Pandora raises
a warning finger to her lips&mdash;A table set for two, an
initialed purse, an ancient theater program&mdash;but the
story waits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De Medici could hear the murmur and exclamations
of the arriving guests. They were gathering
in the large reception hall&mdash;painters, men and
women of the stage, poets, dilettantes&mdash;the charming
crew of professionals who had formed a background
for Victor Ballau&rsquo;s fastidious existence.</p>
<p>There was a sound of women beginning to weep,
of men uttering cries of disbelief, of police ordering
guests into the adjoining room to wait. De
Medici sighed. This was to have been the gala
night&mdash;raised wineglasses, toasts and laughter.
He looked at the figure on the floor with the dagger
protruding from its heart. Suicide!</p>
<p>Yes, the detective whose keen blue eyes had covered
the situation said that Victor Ballau, charming,
easy-mannered connoisseur of wines, pictures
and people, had suddenly ended his life. Preposterous!
De Medici glanced at the lieutenant. A
clumsy ruse, perhaps, to throw someone off
guard. Yet the man seemed simple. His voice
contained an unmistakable ring of sincerity.
Lieutenant Norton was talking again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has that table usually been in this room?&rdquo; he
asked. He pointed to a walnut-topped card table
standing beside the fireplace. De Medici shook
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw that before,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if two people might have been sitting
at that table preparing to eat,&rdquo; the detective
smiled.</p>
<p>De Medici noted the contents of the table top
with surprise. It was a detail that had escaped
him. There were two glasses and an opened wine
bottle between them, several empty plates and a
napkin. But he noticed neither cutlery nor sign of
food. Norton rose as he studied this strange fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A middle-aged, medical-looking man with a bald
head had entered the room. Norton introduced
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Greer,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The doctor greeted De Medici with a nod and
leaned over the body on the floor. His fingers
felt around the imbedded dagger for a moment,
and then slowly withdrew the weapon. He
straightened, holding the dripping blade to the
light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Through the heart,&rdquo; he commented briefly.
&ldquo;Death was almost instantaneous. An odd sort of
knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call Miss Ballau,&rdquo; declared Norton. He
gave a direction to his assistant who had remained
silent and motionless near the wall.</p>
<p>Florence arrived. De Medici, waiting nervously,
his fists clenched on his knees, breathed deeply as
she entered. Her vivid face was white. Her
eyes were lowered. But behind the collapse of her
manner De Medici sensed a tautness, a defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll talk quietly,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and tell
nothing. Beautiful, how beautiful she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective had started his questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did you come home, Miss Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half-past ten,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing in &lsquo;The Dead Flower,&rsquo; aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must have left before the show was
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I had a frightful headache.
The day&rsquo;s excitement, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes turned to De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I proposed to Miss Ballau today,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and our engagement was to have been
announced tonight at the supper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl went on, and De Medici caught
a grateful glint in her eyes, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go on with
the play. I felt I&rsquo;d forget my lines and I asked the
stage manager to let my understudy take my place.
I came home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten-thirty,&rdquo; repeated the detective.</p>
<p>Florence nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get in?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rang the bell several times and Jane finally
answered it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. She&rsquo;d been busy in the kitchen. She
went right back to her work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she know that anything had happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She seemed entirely calm and went back
to the kitchen without saying anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the door to the library closed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another door at the end of the hallway
that shuts off the kitchen, isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two doors. The dining room&rsquo;s
between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if the library door and the two other doors
were closed things could happen in this room without
anybody hearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did you do when you came into the
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came into the library and saw this,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Ballau,&rdquo; Norton smiled at
her. &ldquo;That will be all for the present. I suggest
you lie down.&rdquo; To the man at the door he added,
&ldquo;Call the housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence stood up and De Medici came to her
side. His eyes had avoided her during the questioning.
But he pressed her arm eagerly with
his fingers now. The lieutenant was watching.
He felt certain of this. So he could say nothing
now. He felt her draw back as they came to the
door, beyond which rose a babble of excited voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Mr. De Medici,&rdquo; Norton&rsquo;s
voice called, &ldquo;will you remain while we examine
the housekeeper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; she murmured close to him.
He opened the door and watched her as she walked
slowly and silently down the corridor. Jane, the
housekeeper, entered and was motioned to the
chair in which Florence had sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; Lieutenant Norton
asked.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes were reddened with crying.
Her voice was indistinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane Mayfield,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you worked for Mr. Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since he&rsquo;s been in New York&mdash;about fifteen
years, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty-four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective paused as the woman began again
to weep. At length he resumed kindly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;When did you first find out Mr. Ballau was
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I let Miss Ballau in and went back to the
kitchen to finish the sandwiches for the supper
and then I heard her scream. I came running out.
She was standing in the door screaming that her
father had been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. It was something about
her father being murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long after you let her in did you hear
Miss Ballau scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a minute or two, because I hadn&rsquo;t
started with the sandwiches. I was just beginning
to cut them again when I heard her scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the detective, &ldquo;that will be
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane walked from the room, her eyes avoiding
the figure of Ballau stretched at her feet as she
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, doctor, and you, Mr. De Medici,&rdquo;
Norton resumed in his natural voice, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see,
I think, that any further investigation will bear
out my impression that Mr. Ballau killed himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; murmured De Medici.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; the detective smiled. &ldquo;We
can go over the obvious details of the case right
here. Of course, there will be a further and thorough
inquiry. But as it stands the case is rather
simple. In the first place, we have here the signs
of what seems to have been a terrific struggle
between the dead man and some assailant. The
struggle took place without attracting the attention
of Jane. Pictures were ripped from the walls,
pottery smashed, chairs overturned, books torn
and thrown around in a fight between Mr. Ballau
and, as I say, a possible assailant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will notice, however&rdquo;&mdash;and Norton&rsquo;s impassive
face warmed under the stimulus of his
reasoning&mdash;&ldquo;you will notice that Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s
attire is absolutely undisturbed. He had evidently
dressed himself for the party tonight. It&rsquo;s a
fresh dress shirt he has on. I&rsquo;ve looked at it
through a glass. There isn&rsquo;t a soil or a finger
mark on it. The tie hasn&rsquo;t been disarranged nor
has the collar been touched. All fresh and clean
as a daisy. The murderer might have straightened
the dead man&rsquo;s clothes, but he couldn&rsquo;t
remove the evidence his hands would have left&mdash;soils,
wrinkles and the like on the linen&mdash;during
a struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll notice again that this table here seems
to have been set for two. One peculiar thing about
it is that there are no knives or forks and no
evidences of food. Another peculiar thing is that
the wine bottle is empty and has been empty for
at least a year. You&rsquo;ll find, if you look closely,
that there is dust inside the neck of the bottle and
that all odor of wine has long gone from it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>De Medici was listening in amazement, thinking
behind the words of the detective, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s clever.
A man clever enough to piece together these
observations would not be telling me all he knew
or thought. He&rsquo;s holding something back....
Yes ... it&rsquo;s a ruse to disarm someone. Me,
perhaps. He keeps looking at my fingers. I
should have washed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Norton paused De Medici said aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the thing in his hand. The false beard.
He tore that off somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Norton answered, &ldquo;off himself before
he died. If you&rsquo;ll look closely you&rsquo;ll see there are
evidences of gum mucilage on his chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici stood up slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing is insane, lieutenant,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Why should a man about to commit suicide
disguise himself in a false beard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see in a moment.&rdquo; Norton waved him
back to his chair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my theory now
and we&rsquo;ll see if it will stand up under investigation.
I purposely avoided asking the housekeeper
a question. Now listen. Mr. Ballau desired to
establish the fact that there was a stranger in
the house. He put the beard on and showed himself
thus disguised to his housekeeper. I&rsquo;m sure
we&rsquo;ll find on asking her that there was a visitor
here&mdash;a man with a black Vandyke. That she
caught a brief glimpse of him. Call the Mayfield
woman again, sergeant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>De Medici waited in silence as the man at the
door stepped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He keeps looking at my fingers,&rdquo; he whispered
to himself. &ldquo;And I touched the dagger. My
finger-prints are on the hilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you searched for finger-prints on the
dagger, lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I examined it carefully. Iron is a bad
receiver. The hilt is of iron and the traces left
are insufficient for any practical evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one question,&rdquo; Norton addressed the
white-faced woman soothingly. &ldquo;Did Mr. Ballau
have any callers in the afternoon or evening after
Mr. De Medici had left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are so many people coming and going in
this house,&rdquo; Jane began, her eyes centered on the
detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, think now, Jane,&rdquo; Norton persisted.
&ldquo;Did you see anybody in the apartment besides
Mr. Ballau ... anybody at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Mr. Ballau,&rdquo; she answered softly. &ldquo;I
saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say and how did he look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was coming out from shaving,&rdquo; Jane
answered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember he said anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that, who did you see after you saw
Mr. Ballau come out from shaving? Now come,
think. I know you&rsquo;re upset, but try to remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective&rsquo;s keen eyes had fastened steadily
on the woman. She stood looking at him in silence,
her face growing white, her own eyes widening.
Then, abruptly, she whispered in a low voice as
if talking to herself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ... he ... I didn&rsquo;t exactly see him. I
can&rsquo;t remember. I only saw somebody for a moment.
Somebody else. Yes, somebody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice went up into a wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you when you saw this somebody
else?&rdquo; Norton persisted softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget,&rdquo; Jane moaned. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s awful!
Somebody else.... I saw somebody.... I remember.
In the hall. I was standing in the hall.
It was dark. He was a tall man. He had a black
beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman, overcome by her emotions, had
fallen forward in her chair. The sergeant came
to her side. Norton turned with a look of triumph
to De Medici and Dr. Greer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;A simple-minded woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And
Ballau knew it would be easy to take her in. And
now for the motive. Suicide usually has a motive
as well as murder. I think we&rsquo;ll find two facts:
Fact number one, that Ballau was heavily insured.
Fact number two, that Ballau was heavily in debt.
Then there is also the fact that his daughter, to
whom he was devoted, was to be married. With
her marriage in sight the father naturally thought
that keeping up this pretense&rdquo;&mdash;Norton indicated
the apartment by a wave of his hand&mdash;&ldquo;was no
longer necessary. We&rsquo;ll probably find that he
knew ruin was inevitable and, desiring to leave
his daughter something out of the wreck, he
thought of his insurance. Insurance often isn&rsquo;t
collectable in a case of suicide, so he camouflaged
the thing to look like murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again De Medici&rsquo;s mind played with the words
of the detective. The man was either feigning or
an imbecile. Ah, he should have washed his
hands! De Medici shuddered. The whole thing
was for his benefit. Fear gleamed suddenly in his
eyes. It was a trap for him. An inexplicable
sense of guilt overpowered him. His eyes fell
from the detective. He continued, however, to
reason as the man talked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;My family cowers inside me,&rdquo; he shivered.
&ldquo;Guilty ... yes, phantoms that cringe before
familiar accusations. Murder.... But this
policeman is absurd. If Ballau wanted to do
something for Florence&mdash;the insurance&mdash;why
should he crush her with his death? And the
false beard ... good God, he would have taken it
off before killing himself and hidden it.... But
Norton will say he wanted to make it look as if
he&rsquo;d snatched it from someone else&rsquo;s face. Yet
the mucilage on his chin. He would have thought
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you begin to feel the logic of the thing?&rdquo;
Norton inquired suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; De Medici answered. &ldquo;It remains
impossible in my mind despite everything you say.
Mr. Ballau was a man of taste. He would not
have gone to such preposterous and unconvincing
details as this&mdash;the disordered room, the ridiculous
idea of a table with an empty wine
bottle....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Norton nodded. &ldquo;But you are figuring
from a wrong point of view. Suicide isn&rsquo;t as sane
and simple a thing as buying a piece of furniture.
A man about to take his life is never normal. I
mentioned two facts which we will probably find to
be the motive. There were unquestionably other
facts operating. But of one thing we may be sure.
The Ballau who killed himself was not the elegant
Mr. Ballau New York knows so well. He was a
man in a hysterical condition. He wasn&rsquo;t the
cultured and calm gentleman you knew, Mr. De
Medici.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;And remember another thing. He was a man
of the theater. When the time came for him to
do the thing&mdash;his nerves on edge, his mind at a
hysterical tension&mdash;he reverted to type. He was
a man of the theater. He wanted to camouflage
it to look like a murder. And the only murders
he knew were murders he had witnessed on the
stage, murders after which the police arrive to find
the table set for two, furniture overturned, clews
everywhere&mdash;candlesticks, crucifixes, signs of a
great struggle&mdash;in the usual second-act climax
fashion. It was his intention to set the stage for
such a murder. But he wasn&rsquo;t himself. He went
about his work with the insane deliberation of a
man who functions automatically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Norton stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll find some among the guests
tonight who&rsquo;ll be able to throw a light on the dead
man&rsquo;s finances and troubles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the
meantime, we&rsquo;ll have the body moved and hold it
in the undertaking rooms until the inquest. Of
course, what I&rsquo;ve outlined here is only the result
of first impressions. But, as I&rsquo;ve said, first
impressions are usually one&rsquo;s best conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective walked out of the room. De
Medici rose to follow. As he did an object fell out
of the heavy upholstered chair in which he had
been sitting. He stooped and picked it up. A
woman&rsquo;s purse. Norton had turned at the door
and De Medici slipped it quickly into his pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;An old purse,&rdquo; he murmured to himself, &ldquo;and
there were some faded silver initials in the
corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests were waiting for him. They
crowded around him, babbling questions, exclamations,
condolences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve taken all our names,&rdquo; one woman
sobbed suddenly. &ldquo;Oh, poor, dear Victor....&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici, his eyes narrowed, his lean face void
of expression, moved from group to group assuring
them that all was being done that could be
done. He tried vainly to obtain a moment&rsquo;s private
talk with Florence. He had learned that she
had retired to her bedroom and was locked in
with a nurse summoned by Norton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in a rather bad condition,&rdquo; the detective
explained as he saw De Medici prowling in the
hallway. &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better leave her alone
for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s watching me,&rdquo; De Medici thought.
&ldquo;Every move I make. He&rsquo;s been standing behind
me as I talked. He was in the doorway of the
bathroom as I washed my hands.&rdquo; He paused in
his thought and shivered as a word whimpered
somewhere in the recesses of his brain ...
&ldquo;guilty ... guilty....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll leave,&rdquo; Lieutenant Norton
remarked suddenly at his side. &ldquo;My men will
remain here. And I&rsquo;ll be back early in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici watched the detective move through
the crowded room to the door. He smiled tiredly
after the man. A few of Ballau&rsquo;s cronies were
remaining. The others were departing in couples
and groups. De Medici led the way into a small
room Ballau had used as an office. Meyerson the
antique dealer, Carvello the painter, and Foreman
the retired Shakespearean actor followed him.
They lighted cigars and began in measured tones
to discuss the qualities of the man who lay dead in
the adjoining room. They had learned of Lieutenant
Norton&rsquo;s theory and derided the detective&rsquo;s
conclusions.</p>
<p>Carvello, a lean, nervous-mannered young man,
shrugged his shoulders as De Medici finished relating
Norton&rsquo;s conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suicide,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Hm. If Ballau put
that beard on to disguise himself as a stranger and
deceive Jane, why should he leave it on until he
had stabbed himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; De Medici sighed, &ldquo;in his confused
and hysterical condition he forgot he was wearing
the thing and remembered only after the dagger
had entered. That&rsquo;s Norton&rsquo;s theory. His last
act was to try to make the camouflage stand up
by tearing the thing from his face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd,&rdquo; snorted Carvello. &ldquo;The doctor said,
I heard him myself, that death was almost instantaneous.
How could he, after striking such a
blow, have lived long enough to tear the thing
from his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or to have placed a crucifix on his chest?&rdquo;
Meyerson took up the argument. &ldquo;Or to have
blown out the candle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of Foreman the old actor rose
sonorously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Ballau wore the false beard. There was
mucilage on his chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put there by the murderer after the crime,&rdquo;
Carvello exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a camouflage there
right enough. But a cleverer one than Norton
figured out. Yes, an unconvincing murder scene&mdash;carefully
prepared by a murderer to enable the
police to penetrate its pretense and arrive at the
theory of suicide. No soils on his linen, no marks
or rumples. Of course not. Ballau was killed by
a man suddenly and without struggle. The camouflage
followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici shook his head. The discussion
seemed curiously pointless to him. There was
the telephone call at the theater&mdash;and there....</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have worn the beard,&rdquo; De Medici
spoke suddenly, &ldquo;but there is more than one reason
to explain that, and there are other ways that
a man can get mucilage on his face than from a
false beard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>He paused and stared tiredly around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather done up ... if you don&rsquo;t mind,
I&rsquo;ll turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ballau&rsquo;s friends looked at him with sympathy
and nodded. As he passed from the room down
the hallway he heard their voices continuing the
monotonous discussion of the dead man&rsquo;s virtues&mdash;and
the clews.</p>
<p>He had been waiting for this moment ever since
Norton and his keen eyes had arrived at the apartment.
The lieutenant was gone. Two dull-faced
men in uniform were guarding the library. De
Medici&rsquo;s manner underwent a change. The listlessness
dropped from his face. He moved
quickly toward the door behind which he knew
Florence was locked. Glancing furtively up and
down the hallway, he knocked softly. A stranger&rsquo;s
voice asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. De Medici. Will you tell Miss Ballau I
want to see her for a moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ballau is asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake her up, please. Tell her it&rsquo;s imperative.
I must see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause during which De Medici heard muffled
whisperings. Then Florence&rsquo;s voice came faintly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please excuse me, Julien. I can&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried the door-knob desperately as he
answered:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important, Florence. Please ... I must
tell you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was locked. De Medici rattled the
knob again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.... Julien. I can&rsquo;t see you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse&rsquo;s voice added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s too upset, sir. You&rsquo;ll have to wait till
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton again.... He had foreseen an attempt
to talk to her. He hesitated before the door. Yes,
the man&rsquo;s theory of suicide had been feigned. An
elaborate web of sophistry to entrap him....</p>
<p>De Medici frowned. He stood staring at the
locked door. Circumstances were repeating themselves
in his head. His subtle brain trained in the
adventure of finely spun ideas found the situation
banal. Yet there was a background, an incomprehensible
background as yet unrevealed.</p>
<p>He repeated slowly to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody called her on the telephone. She
fled in answer to the call. She left the theater at
nine-forty. Less than ten minutes to the apartment.
Yes, I made it in ten and she was in a
greater hurry than I. So it was nine-fifty when
she reached the apartment. And it was ten-thirty
when I entered the vestibule downstairs and saw
her come out of the elevator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood with his hand on the knob. His
strange face became haunted with fears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;She was in the apartment for more than a
half hour,&rdquo; he stood thinking. &ldquo;She lied about
that to Norton. She lied, too, about the telephone
call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The locked door stared back at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must hold on to myself,&rdquo; he whispered aloud.</p>
<p>Something had spoken in him. There was a
voice, subtle and exultant, that reared itself phantom-like
amid his thoughts. It was urging him to
enter the locked door, to fall at the feet of the
woman inside the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;she lures me. I believe her
guilty ... a murderess, a Messalina. And the
fact lures me. De Medicis hail her. De Medici
ghosts inside me prostrate themselves devoutly
before a kinswoman&mdash;a woman whose hands are
red with murder.... An impulse toward obeisance
stirs in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shuddered at his thoughts. His head was
beginning to ache. He walked to a guest-room
and turned on the light. Then he remembered
something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a purse in the room ... in the
chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned tiredly at himself in a dressing
mirror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must watch this duality in me,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;She is guilty&mdash;yes, things whisper it
inside me.... I know this because I feel drawn
to her ... to her guilt. A kinswoman for the
prowling ones in me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied his face in the mirror with a shiver.
De Medici looked back at him.... Narrow,
inscrutable eyes regarded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my eyes,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>His hands had withdrawn the purse. An ornate
thing of an obsolete style. He opened it. The
lining was torn inside. Folded in the bottom was a
theater program. He studied it.... A program
of &ldquo;Iris,&rdquo; played at the Goldsmith Theater in
London in 1899 ... a repertoire company.</p>
<p>He replaced the dried paper carefully and closed
the purse. In the lower right-hand corner of the
leather were two initials in silver&mdash;F. B.</p>
<p>He raised the thing to his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; he whispered, his dark eyes
flashing with a sudden excitement. &ldquo;Yes, she
left the theater with her make-up on and in the
costume of the &lsquo;Dead Flower.&rsquo; And in the lobby
screaming ... when I saw her first she had
changed. There was no make-up on her face&mdash;and
her clothes were changed. Thirty-five minutes in
which to ... change. She lied ... she lied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat smiling enigmatically at the purse. The
subtle and exultant voice that had risen in him
before the locked door was again speaking among
his thoughts:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Francesca mia, I adore you. Beautiful, cruel
and silent one ... murderess! Patricide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a strange moment his heart seemed to fling
itself blissfully toward the image of a woman
smiling grimly, dagger in hand, in the opened
doorway of his room. His eyes stared at blankness
while an inner vision beheld her&mdash;Florence
in a trailing robe ... Florence with her black
hair smoothed and bound with a gold band, with a
dagger lifted and a dark smile wavering over the
cruel face....</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet, a cry in his throat. The
doorway was empty. He stood shuddering before
it, afraid to look beyond into the darkened hall,
cowering before the shadow of a chair that
stretched against the wall. Something had
passed&mdash;a shadow had passed. With hands
grown moist, he walked stiffly forward and closed
out the empty space. He was alone in the room.</p>
<p>He stood still listening, as if there were noises
to overhear. His eyes shifted about the vacancy
of the room. They turned furtively from the
unoccupied chairs to the empty bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It traps me ... a
disease....&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fully lighted room De Medici flung himself
with a sob on the bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which the world wags its callous tongue&mdash;In which
d&eacute;nouements thumb their noses at each other&mdash;In
which Julien De Medici succumbs to a delicious madness&mdash;A
Jesuitical policeman and an ambitious coroner
flirt coyly with an Enigma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was an inquest. Newspaper headlines
bombarded the mystery. The grateful press
panted ecstatically on the trail of clews, conjectures,
romances, and revelations. A crowd filled
the street in front of the fashionable Park Avenue
apartment building. They stood watching officials
and the spotlighted figures of mystery enter.</p>
<p>The Ballau apartment itself was thronged with
witnesses and friends of the dead man. Coroner
Holbein had taken charge of the investigation
and official gathering of evidence.</p>
<p>The famous Ballau library had been converted
into a courtroom. The melodrama of the &ldquo;Crucifix
Mystery&rdquo;&mdash;an identity provided by some of the
papers&mdash;had a setting worthy of itself. Six men
summoned at random to serve as a coroner&rsquo;s jury
sat nervously in the Renaissance chairs that had
been lined up in front of the fireplace. Coroner
Holbein had taken his position behind a work-table
introduced from another portion of the
house. At his right side sat Lieutenant Norton
and Dr. Greer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>In front of the coroner stretched an assortment
of chairs occupied by friends of the dead man.
The newspaper men, expectant of revelations,
bristled nervously about the officials.</p>
<p>Coroner Holbein opened the inquest with a brief
address to the jury. He was an oracular man. It
was his habit, when speaking in the presence of the
press, to indulge in rotund medico-legal sentences.
The six blinking jurymen listened with an air of
ponderous sagacity. Neither they nor the coroner
seemed definitely aware of what was being said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for you gentlemen to determine whether
Victor Ballau has been the victim of a foul and
dastardly crime, by which I mean whether he was
sought out in the sanctity of his home and assassinated
by some man or woman unknown, or
whether for reasons yet unknown, but which we
hope this inquiry will uncover, Victor Ballau ended
his own life. The case, as you no doubt have read,
gentlemen, presents many baffling aspects. After
you have listened to the testimony given by the
various witnesses the city of New York has subp&oelig;naed
for this occasion, it will then be your duty
as citizens to return a verdict determining who
it was, if you have been able to discover from the
evidence, that was guilty of this foul and dastardly
crime, or a verdict determining whether or not
Victor Ballau, for reasons which may be unfolded
here, killed himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Coroner Holbein, reddened by his effort, came
to an end of his pompous admonition with a flourish
of his gavel. Despite his unhappy oratorical
obsession he was a man of shrewd perceptions. In
a business-like voice he summoned his stenographer
and announced to the room that the inquest
would now proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take the stand, Dr. Greer?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Greer arose and seated himself in the chair
facing the coroner which had been provided for
the witnesses. In answer to a few brief questions
he described in medical language the cause of
death, concluding with the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in my opinion, death was caused by a
shock resulting from a perforation of the heart.
The perforation was caused by the introduction
of a sharp steel instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There followed a short examination, in which
both questions and answers seemed the product
of a well rehearsed scene.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Is this dagger I now show you the dagger
you removed from the body of Victor Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;To what extent had it penetrated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;The entire blade was imbedded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Q. &ldquo;In your opinion, doctor, it would take considerable
force to drive a dagger seven inches into
a man&rsquo;s body, would it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It would if the point encountered any
resistance. In this case, however, the blow was so
placed that the weapon slid under the ribs without
encountering any obstacle until it had gone its
full course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;From the position of the dagger in the
body, how would you say the blow had been
inflicted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;That is hard to say. It may have been
struck from many angles. One thing, however, is
obvious. The dagger followed a slightly upward
course after penetration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What do you deduce from that, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Nothing definite can be deduced from that
except that it was an upward blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Would a man stabbing himself inflict such
a wound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, that might be. A man stabbing himself
might either strike downward, or, if he knew
a little of anatomy, take the more effective way
of striking upward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;In your opinion, how long after the wound
was inflicted did death occur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I should say instantaneously, or at the
most a matter of five or ten seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coroner Holbein beamed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Call Miss Jane
Mayfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dressed in black, the gaunt housekeeper was
ushered to the witness chair. She appeared
bewildered as the eyes of the crowded room centered
on her. Coroner Holbein, clearing his
throat, assumed the manner of a friend of the
weak and a staff for the unfortunate. After a
series of perfunctory questions he arrived at the
day of the mystery.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;And now, Jane, tell us simply and in your
own way what happened that afternoon and
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Mr. Ballau was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;We know that, Jane. But before he was
killed what happened? What orders did he give
you that afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He told me there was going to be a party.
He told me to order supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;How did he seem to you when he gave you
these orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t remember noticing
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did you do after receiving his
orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I called the caterer around the corner and
gave him Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s orders and then I worked
around the house fixing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see Mr. De Medici that day?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes. Mr. De Medici and Mr. Ballau were
together for a while after dinner. Mr. Ballau told
him to go away as he interfered with getting the
party ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;In what way did Mr. De Medici interfere,
if you know, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I heard Mr. Ballau say he was too excited
and that he was no use whatsoever, and to go out
and walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile passed through the room at the housekeeper&rsquo;s
words. The romance between De Medici
and Ballau&rsquo;s daughter had received its share of
spotlighting during the week that followed the
tragedy. Curious ones turned their heads for a
glimpse of the couple. At the side of the room,
hidden behind a row of chairs, they were rewarded.
Florence Ballau, her vivid face behind a
veil, and Julien De Medici&rsquo;s green-tinted cheeks
and decorative features occupied adjoining seats.
They were sitting, eyes straight&mdash;unwavering and
attentive.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;After Mr. De Medici went away, what
happened then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I was busy. I don&rsquo;t remember anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see Mr. Ballau after Mr. De
Medici went away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He came out from shaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did he say anything at that time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see anybody else in the apartment
after you had encountered Mr. Ballau as stated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper paused before answering. Her
eyes swung bewilderedly toward the listeners.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;There now, Jane. Think carefully and see
if you recall having seen another man or woman
in the apartment following Mr. De Medici&rsquo;s leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the housekeeper stared distractedly at
the crowd of listeners.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;On the night of Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s death, when
you were questioned by Lieutenant Norton you
said that you remembered catching a glimpse of a
tall man with a black beard. Have you forgotten
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper regarded the coroner with
frightened eyes. For several moments she
remained silent.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Come, Jane, do you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Oh, yes. I remember now. I only saw
him for a second. I&rsquo;d forgotten about that. A
tall man with a black, pointed beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Had you ever seen that man before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears came suddenly into the housekeeper&rsquo;s
eyes. The coroner paused with a great show of
tenderness as she dried them.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;After you saw this man with the black
beard, tell us what happened then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I was busy in the kitchen arranging the
sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What time was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;About nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you hear any sounds in the house
while you were thus busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Well, go on, then. Tell us what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;If there had been any sounds in the
library, sounds such as might be made by a violent
struggle, would you have heard them from where
you were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir! I&rsquo;m sure I would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you remember when Miss Ballau
returned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What time was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper again hesitated. The frightened
expression returned to her eyes. She
wavered until, turning, she encountered the
attentive gaze of Florence Ballau. With a sigh
she looked back at the coroner.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember what time it was. I
didn&rsquo;t look.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you let Miss Ballau into the apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes. The bell rang and I answered the
door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did Miss Ballau do or say, if anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. I was busy. I went
right back to the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;When I got into the kitchen I heard Miss
Ballau screaming and I rushed out in the hall.
Miss Ballau was standing in the library door and
screaming about her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Just what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. She was screaming. I
went in and saw Mr. Ballau on the floor. I began
to cry.... I don&rsquo;t remember....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Come now, Jane, pull yourself together.
Do you remember how Mr. Ballau was lying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;On his back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you notice anything odd about the
room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, it was all torn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you notice whether a candle was burning
in a candlestick beside the head of the dead
man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The housekeeper stared speechlessly at the
coroner. The question had sent a shiver through
the crowd. The hollow eyes of the woman
widened. She spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice any candle burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you ever hear anyone quarreling with
Mr. Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;How did Mr. Ballau treat you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper failed to answer. She was
looking slowly around the room. Suddenly, with
a cry, she fell forward. Her head lay on the table
as the sound of hysterical weeping filled the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all, thank you,&rdquo; said the coroner.
A policeman assisted Jane to her feet and led her
sobbing from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Mr. Donovan,&rdquo; ordered the coroner.</p>
<p>Donovan, the doorman of the Hudson Apartments,
in which building the dead man had lived,
took his place stolidly in the witness chair. Under
questioning he identified himself and his vocation.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Mr. Donovan, you were on duty, were you
not, on the night Mr. Ballau met his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, sir; I was that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Were you acquainted with the dead
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Indeed, when he was alive I was well
acquainted with him. I&rsquo;d known Mr. Ballau for
years, and a very fine man he was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you know most of the people who
came to visit Mr. Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I did that. I knew most of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Between the hours of seven and ten-thirty
on the night Mr. Ballau was found dead, do you
know who came into the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Well, now, I remember there was some of
the residents came in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;I mean, did you notice any strangers enter
or any people you knew to be friends of Mr.
Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No, sir. There was only Miss Ballau and
the gentleman, Mr. De Medici, your honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see Miss Ballau come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m saying, sir. There was
the young lady and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What time was it when Miss Ballau
entered the building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;To tell the truth, sir, I didn&rsquo;t notice
exactly. My watch had stopped the day before
and I had it at the repairer&rsquo;s....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Can you tell approximately what time it
was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Well, it was after being middlin&rsquo; late.
Around ten o&rsquo;clock, I should say, or thereafter
somewhat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you pay any attention to Miss Ballau
when she came in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;No, I wasn&rsquo;t very attentive, your honor.
I was only for noticing it was her and that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see a man with a black beard
enter the apartment that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I did not. I don&rsquo;t remember if there
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you know any man with a black beard
who ever called on Mr. Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Well, now, there was Dr. Lytton, who
used to come often, and he had a black beard, but
he got rid of it a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;He got rid of it. In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;By shaving, your honor, I presume.
Leastways I was hardly for recognizing him when
he came around without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you see Dr. Lytton in the room,
Donovan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short, thick-set, bull-necked man with a
glistening bald head stood up near the wall.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the gentleman himself, your
honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coroner Holbein regarded the standing man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Dr. Lytton,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see Dr. Lytton the night Mr.
Ballau was found dead, the night of April 10th?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No, sir, I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see Mr. De Medici come in that
night?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall, to be exact, your honor. I
remember I heard the young lady screaming and
that it was Mr. De Medici holding her in his arms
and telling me to call the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all, thank you,&rdquo; the coroner
nodded.</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes narrowed and a derisive smile
passed over his wide, thin mouth. He had followed
the questions and answers with rigid
attentiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A terrible dolt, this man. Or in on the trap,&rdquo;
he mused. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t over. They&rsquo;ve got something
hidden. Yet he didn&rsquo;t ask Donovan the
question. The answer would have started things.
How long after she came in from the street did
he see her in my arms? Thirty or forty minutes
later.... He would have remembered if asked.
And what was she doing in the apartment those
thirty or forty minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five days had passed since the death of his
friend and a curious change had come over De
Medici. His hand trembled as he dropped it furtively
on the gloved fingers of the girl at his side.
She ignored the caress. A laceration passed
through his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cold, aloof and defiant,&rdquo; he mused with a shudder.
&ldquo;She sits next to me like an image of stone.
This little hand I touch is the hand that murdered.
Yet it lies calmly in a snug glove under my fingers.
It is I who tremble. This thing grows in me. The
feeling of her guilt overwhelms me. Her cruelty
is like the promise of a caress. I bow before it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Again a shudder stirred him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incredible,&rdquo; he went on silently. &ldquo;There is
a mystery. She could not sit like this if there was
a memory of guilt in her. And yet she lies. She
avoids me. If it was I who had killed him ...
yes, I could sit like this. Calm, amused and
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici sighed. He had for the week followed
the circle of his thoughts. The shuddering and
exultant thing that had risen in him on the night
before the locked door had obliterated, almost, his
curiosity concerning the crime. Shrinking from
himself, despising the evil infatuation that the
conviction of her guilt was developing in him, he
had felt himself being slowly dragged into a dark
region of himself. Alone in his rooms he had sat
through the nights musing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m changing. I feel myself losing the
identity of Julien De Medici. The phantoms come
closer to my brain. They knock warily at my
heart....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He released the unresponsive hand of the girl
as the coroner raised his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call Mr. Philip Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>A well-dressed, quick-mannered man, middle-aged
and important-aired, stepped forward and
took his place in the witness chair. He identified
himself as a broker on the stock exchange. The
coroner proceeded.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You were intimately acquainted with the
deceased, were you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;In what capacity did you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;We were friends and I handled a great
part of his business dealings and investments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What was the nature of these investments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Stock investments, chiefly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You mean Mr. Ballau played the stock
market?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;How much money did Mr. Ballau invest
through you during the last few years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I have looked over my books and find that
Mr. Ballau invested something like $350,000 in the
last year and a half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;And what became of these investments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Mr. Ballau was unfortunate. The money
was entirely lost as a result of several unforeseen
flurries on the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Then you wish us to understand that Mr.
Ballau in the course of a year and a half lost
$350,000 as a result of stock market fluctuations?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did Mr. Ballau appear oppressed over his
loss or did he so express himself at any time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, he took the matter keenly to heart.
Towards the end he seemed to lose some of the
conservatism which usually marked his business
investments and tried frantically to recover what
he had lost. Against my advice he invested in
speculative securities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did Mr. Ballau, during any conversation
with you, express himself as overwhelmed by his
losses and reveal in any way that he was brooding
over them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Mr. Ballau took his losses without any
complaint. He kept his emotions to himself. But
from the way he acted and from many things I
saw, I felt certain that he was frantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the coroner. &ldquo;That will
be all. Call Mr. William Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stout, genial-looking man took the witness
chair and under questioning identified himself as
an attorney.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You were Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s lawyer, were you
not; retained by him to handle his estate and whatever
litigation arose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Mr. Ballau left a will, did he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;When did he make out this will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Eight days ago. April 2nd.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did Mr. Ballau have a will previous to the
drawing up of this will that you testify took place
April 2nd, or eight days before his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He did. When I was first retained as
legal adviser by Mr. Ballau some nine years ago,
he entrusted to my keeping, among other papers,
his last will and testament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;When Mr. Ballau made out his new will on
April 2nd was this other will destroyed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Who destroyed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Mr. Ballau did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you remember what was in that will
and what disposition of his property Mr. Ballau
had made in it? I refer to the first will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I never saw that will. It was handed to
me sealed and I kept it in Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s box along
with other papers until he asked for it eight days
ago. I gave it to him and he tore it up without
looking at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;He tore it up. I see. And what did he do
with the pieces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It was at his home. There was a fire
burning in the room and he threw the pieces in
the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;And then you drew up the second will?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Has that second will been probated yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you desire at this time to divulge its
contents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;There is little to divulge. Mr. Ballau
merely dictated a memorandum bequeathing all
his property and holdings in the event of his death
to Miss Florence Ballau, his daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Was she present when the will was drawn
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;She was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Are you in a position to know the extent
of Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s holdings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Tell us, then, to the best of your knowledge,
how large an estate Mr. Ballau left behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He left nothing behind. As far as I have
been able to find out, he was heavily in debt at the
time of his death. His present possessions, if
sold, would barely pay for the chattel mortgages
and loans. He was penniless when he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you know whether he was insured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes. Mr. Ballau was insured for
$150,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you know what kind of a policy he
held?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;A straight death insurance policy collectable
in the event of his demise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Is there a suicide clause in that policy,
Mr. Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;I believe there is. I believe that the policy
provides that its conditions shall be null and
void in the event of its holder taking his own
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Has any effort been made to collect that
insurance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;None whatsoever, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; beamed the coroner. &ldquo;Call Mr.
Meyerson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Meyerson walked to the witness chair. Following
the introductory questions the coroner
proceeded.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You frequently sold antiques to Mr. Ballau
during his life, did you not, Mr. Meyerson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;How are his accounts now? I mean, has
he paid you his bills and was he in the habit of
paying regularly, or do your books show that his
estate is indebted to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Mr. Ballau owed me $12,000 at the time
of his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you ever press for payment of this
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;During my fifteen years of dealing with
Mr. Ballau I have never sent him a bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What was the last thing Mr. Ballau
bought from you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;My books show that on March 28th Mr.
Ballau purchased a Florentine dagger which
formed a part of the famous De Medici collection
in my keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Is this the dagger which Mr. Ballau purchased
from you on March 28th?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coroner held aloft the slim weapon which
had been found protruding from Victor Ballau&rsquo;s
heart.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, without a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Were you there when the purchase was
made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What was said at the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;We discussed the dagger. Mr. Ballau
was always a collector. I remember his enthusiasm
over the weapon. He declared it an excellent
piece of workmanship and wondered over its
history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did you say, Mr. Meyerson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;We discussed the sinister history which
undoubtedly was attached to the dagger. It had
been, according to my information, one of the
weapons Catherine De Medici carried into France
with her. As such it had unquestionably been in
many a bloody drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Was Mr. Ballau alone when the purchase
was made?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;He came in alone but as we were talking
Julien De Medici entered. He joined us in our
discussion over the weapon, contributing to its
sinister and romantic past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What, exactly, if you remember, did Mr.
De Medici say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I recall that he humorously bewailed the
habits of his great-great-grandmother and added
that if he had enough money he would buy
the entire De Medici collection in my keeping and
drop it in the middle of the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all, Mr. Meyerson,&rdquo; said the
coroner. &ldquo;Call Miss Florence Ballau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A climax! Florence Ballau.... There had
been innuendoes in the press. She arose&mdash;a figure
out of the depths of melodrama. Her black attire,
the tilted and somber hat that shadowed her face&mdash;the
night-flower face that had captured Broadway....</p>
<p>&ldquo;As beautiful and imperious as a somnambulist,&rdquo;
mused De Medici. He felt his heart move
after her as she left her seat. &ldquo;And now they
will uncover their little traps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes turned fearfully to the silent and reddish
Lieutenant Norton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An amiable spider,&rdquo; he shivered, &ldquo;he waits
for her. And she ... dear God ... she will
walk slowly and aloofly into his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was stirring with excitement. Murmurs
arose around him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;Later ... later,&rdquo; De Medici whispered to
himself. A warm enervation was sweeping him.
&ldquo;My love makes a stranger out of me,&rdquo; he went
on. &ldquo;Ah, Francesca mia. Cruel and beautiful
Francesca....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat smiling furtively as the figure of Florence
Ballau lowered itself gracefully into the witness
chair. His eyes, narrowed and inscrutable,
followed the vibrant line of her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not detain you long,&rdquo; the coroner
began, affecting a heavily cavalierly manner.
&ldquo;But it is necessary for the purposes of this record
to learn from you again the story of your finding
your father&rsquo;s body. Do you wish to testify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young woman nodded once, answering in a
soft contralto, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The examination proceeded.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You were engaged, at the time of your
father&rsquo;s death, to marry Mr. Julien De Medici,
were you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;And the party your father was giving was
in the nature of a formal announcement of the
engagement, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q &ldquo;When did you last see your father alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;In the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;How did he seem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A &ldquo;He was depressed ... and sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q &ldquo;What gave you that impression?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;We talked. He told me he was ruined.
He said that he had been wiped out on the stock
market and that we were penniless and would
have to sell all we owned to meet our debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Your father was devoted to his collections&mdash;his
antiques and books, was he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes. They were his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Tell us, if you will, what else did your
father say to you on the morning of April 10th?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He said he was sorry to have brought
this on just as my career was beginning. He
said he had put his last money into the play in
which I was acting and that it, too, seemed likely
to fail him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you recall what you said in reply,
Miss Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes. I told him it didn&rsquo;t matter. But he
refused to be consoled. He said it was not the
money but the parting with the beautiful things
he had loved all his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did he make any threats against his own
life at the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He spoke of his insurance. He said that
there came a time in every man&rsquo;s life when he was
worth more dead than alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What reply did you make to that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;I kissed him and begged him not to be
absurd. I told him that I loved him. Then I
said good-bye and went to keep my appointment
with Mr. De Medici.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see your father alive after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What time did you leave the theater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. It was after the second
act. I had a frightful headache and the worry
over what father had told me, added to the excitement
of the morning&mdash;I had promised to marry
Mr. De Medici&mdash;upset me too much to finish the
play. I asked the stage manager to call my understudy
and left the theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you go straight home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What time did you reach the apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I went straight up in the
elevator, intending to take a nap before the party
started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you usually carry a key to your apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I had one until several weeks ago. I lost
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;So you rang and the housekeeper let you
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What was her demeanor when she opened
the door?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;I noticed nothing about her. She was not
disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did you do after you entered the
apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I removed my wraps and opened the door
to the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you go into your room first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did you see when you entered the
library?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;That my father had been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Were the lights on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He was lying on the floor on his back. I
saw the dagger-handle. I stood looking at him.
Then I screamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you notice anything else unusual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;An ebony crucifix was on his body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;A candle was standing by his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Was it lighted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You are positive of that? Or is it possible
that in your grief and excitement you may
have blown it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It was unlighted. There was only moonlight
in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You screamed and rushed out to give the
alarm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Have you any theory as to how your
father met his death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I think ... he killed himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all, Miss Ballau,&rdquo; the coroner
announced.</p>
<p>She arose and steadied herself for a moment
with her fingers on the edge of the table. The eyes
of De Medici remained on her. She walked slowly
back to the chair beside him. The coroner and
Lieutenant Norton were conferring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inconceivable imbeciles,&rdquo; De Medici&rsquo;s musing
began again. &ldquo;They let her go. They had only
to confront her with the telephone call. Cort must
have told them, as he told me. And her flight from
the theater. Either they have neither eyes nor
intelligence ... or they wait. Ah, he looks at
me. Next ... yes, they will ask me questions
now. There was blood on my hands when the
detective came in. I must remember to explain
about that. Hm, they keep whispering. They
know something. About whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes turned slowly toward Florence. He
would speak to her. Had she forgotten that he
loved her, that his heart was at her feet? Yes,
she was cold. Even in the cab.... She had
spoken calmly, almost indifferently, during their
ride. But her arms had come around him. A
kiss&mdash;a long, burning kiss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>A shudder of delight confused the memory. He
heard his name called. He stood up and walked to
the chair, his brain clear again. He was calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be careful,&rdquo; his thought continued as he
approached the table. &ldquo;They are waiting with
something ... I must not corroborate the suicide.
They know better. It&rsquo;s part of a plan ...
against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed stiffly to the coroner and sat down.
He leaned back in the chair, his hands folded in
his lap, and answered the opening questions with
precision. Having established his identity and
his connection with the Ballau family, the coroner
proceeded.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Now tell us, Mr. De Medici, when you last
saw Mr. Ballau alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It was around eight o&rsquo;clock that evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What was he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He was telephoning people to come to the
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;How did he impress you with regard to
his state of mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;He was in good spirits. He was pleased
that I had obtained Miss Ballau&rsquo;s consent to
marry me. He seemed as happy as myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;And you left the apartment around
eight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I walked in Broadway for an hour,
dropped in at the Rienza for a bite of food, and
then went to call for Miss Ballau at the theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What time was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be necessary to lie here. But he must
be careful and evasive wherever possible.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It was twenty minutes after ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you see Miss Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No, she had just left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you ask any questions of anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, they had Cort up their sleeve. They would
produce him next and confound him with the
man&rsquo;s testimony. De Medici&rsquo;s eyes glanced
slowly around the room as if in quest of a memory.
Cort was not to be seen.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember to whom I spoke. I
recall asking someone where Miss Ballau was and
they told me she had left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you think it strange that Miss Ballau
should leave the theater in the middle of the
show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah, now they were closing in. His eyes rested
intently upon the reddish face of Lieutenant Norton.
The man was watching him, as he had
watched him that night in the apartment.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes, I thought it odd. But I knew Miss
Ballau was under mental stress.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What sort of mental stress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;She had been distracted in the morning
when we rode in a cab together and I asked her to
marry me. She had told me about her father. She
was worried over him and she had complained of
a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simple lies, establishing nothing. De Medici
glanced at his hands. Would they ask him about
the blood on his fingers?</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Do you think that Mr. Ballau committed
suicide, from what you saw that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Then it is your opinion that Mr. Ballau
was murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici waited while the coroner made notes
with a pencil. Curious that he should make notes
at that moment. And why had they asked him for
his opinion? They had asked none of the others.
Norton again. Yes, it was Norton. The coroner
with his pompous words and heavy manner was
a blind. It was the reddish-faced man beside him
who was operating the web ... spinning it out
carefully and invisibly. Well, he would cross
weapons with the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must find out what the fellow is,&rdquo; mused
De Medici behind the attentive poise of his face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Have you any idea from your observations,
Mr. De Medici, by whom the dead man was
murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You were present with Lieutenant Norton
in the library when the first examination was
made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What time did you arrive at the Ballau
apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall the exact time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did Miss Ballau have her hat on when she
came out of the elevator as you entered the
lobby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;How was she dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they knew about the costume!</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember. I failed to notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What gave you the impression that murder
had been committed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;It was obvious. The room was in disorder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You discussed the case at the time with
Lieutenant Norton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes. I am aware of his theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici surprised a look of amusement in
the detective&rsquo;s face. An irritation came into his
nerves. Yes, they were playing, peering out
amusedly from behind concealed evidence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;May I speak openly?&rdquo; De Medici inquired.
He had leaned forward in his chair. He caught
a nod from the lieutenant. The coroner answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Go on and tell us in your own way what
you believe happened. We want to get at the
bottom of this mystery and if you have any ideas
as a result of what you know we will be glad to
hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the questions that were asked Miss Ballau,&rdquo;
De Medici began, his eyes fixed on the
lieutenant, &ldquo;it struck me that one of the police
theories might be that Miss Ballau killed her
father in order to profit by his insurance money,
knowing at the time that they were financially
ruined. This is obviously a ridiculous notion. For
Miss Ballau has testified from the first that she is
convinced her father committed suicide. Inasmuch
as she knows that if this is proved the
insurance company will not have to pay her the
money that is collectable if Mr. Ballau was murdered,
the theory becomes untenable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the coroner. &ldquo;But we have not
as yet made any remarks or comments which might
be construed as supporting such a theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Norton leaned forward and spoke
for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any particular interest in proving
that a murder has been committed instead of
suicide?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean,&rdquo; De Medici smiled
slowly. &ldquo;I am engaged to marry Miss Ballau and
you think I have a personal interest in securing
the collection of the insurance money left by her
father. I have no such interest. I knew Mr.
Ballau as well as I know anybody in the world.
Had he decided to kill himself and conceal the
fact, he would have done so in an intelligent
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We discussed that once,&rdquo; smiled the detective.
De Medici nodded. The coroner, after a pause,
continued his questioning.</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You heard Mr. Meyerson testify concerning
the purchase of the dagger found in Mr.
Ballau&rsquo;s body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Did you have any discussion with Mr. Ballau
concerning the weapon after he had taken it
home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A charming theory and worthy of a more
romantic-looking person than the reddish-faced
Norton. De Medici smiled appreciatively at the
detective.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I think we did talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;On that night in the library you asked
Lieutenant Norton whether he had observed any
finger-prints on the hilt, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;What did you say to Mr. Ballau concerning
the dagger?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>A. &ldquo;I told him I didn&rsquo;t like it. It had belonged
to an ancestor of mine whose deeds I have never
admired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;You have a revulsion toward such things&mdash;daggers
of that kind, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I fancy I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Q. &ldquo;Yet you touched it when you leaned over
the body of Mr. Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici stared again at the detective. A
memory focused vividly in his mind. The dead
body, the dagger hilt, the moment he had reached
forward to embrace the protruding thing in his
fingers&mdash;the moment of fascination that had left
him shuddering. Ah, this reddish-faced man was
not stupid. He had surmised that.</p>
<p>A. &ldquo;I thought of withdrawing the blade from
the body but stopped as my fingers encountered
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be all,&rdquo; the coroner announced.</p>
<p>De Medici arose and returned to his seat beside
Florence. The coroner and Lieutenant Norton
were conferring in whispers again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inquest is a farce,&rdquo; De Medici mused.
&ldquo;They have determined on this clumsy ruse of
throwing someone off guard as I thought that
night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Lieutenant Norton, summoned to the witness
chair, was reciting again the details of the case.
De Medici listened. With logic and a remarkably
convincing mass of detail, the detective was going
over the circumstances surrounding the death of
Victor Ballau, and bit by bit reconstructing for
the jury his theory of the grotesque suicide which
the dead man had committed. He added to his
theory the motive that had been brought out by
the witnesses, the dead man&rsquo;s financial difficulties,
the changing of his will, his purchase of the
dagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inquest stands adjourned until tomorrow,&rdquo;
Coroner Holbein announced as the lieutenant
concluded.</p>
<p>De Medici remained, without moving, beside the
girl. A respite. Nothing had happened. There
would be no damning headlines in the press. His
eyes studied the face of the girl. She was in
danger. The clumsy evasions of the officials were
ominous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I would like to talk
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way through the crowd of
friends. De Medici nodded politely in return to
the greetings that followed his passage through
the room. Norton was watching them, watching
them go out together. There would be someone
listening when they talked. De Medici leaned
close to her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get away. Alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;The theater,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>It would be empty. Seated on the empty stage
facing the vacant seats, they could be certain of
not being overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have avoided me,&rdquo; he said as they walked
in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They continued in silence. The morning was
brisk. Inside the theater, he led the way to the
stage. The curtain was up. The scenery for the
first act of his play was in place&mdash;dungeon walls
and a single door at the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve probably been followed,&rdquo; he said softly
as they sat down in two chairs near the dark
footlights. &ldquo;But we can talk easily here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You have forgotten
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you hide from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To warn you,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;They know
about the telephone call. And about the time you
spent in the apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was soft. His hand sought hers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Francesca mia, do you think I care? Does
it matter to me? Look at me. Do my eyes hide
from you? I adore you. Tell me ... and I will
fall at your feet. I will kiss your hands....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I killed him?&rdquo; Her voice was low in a
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you wish. Only tell me so I can love
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am mad with desire for you. Nothing matters
to me but that my heart bows before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe I killed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to save you. They know all I know.
We must circumvent them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a purse in the chair that night,&rdquo; he
whispered. &ldquo;With your initials on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me.&rdquo; She held out her hand. He
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First you must tell me what you know. Then
I will obey you blindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici smiled at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone called you on the telephone,&rdquo; he said
softly. &ldquo;And you answered, &lsquo;Oh, God!&rsquo; and fled.
You were in the apartment for a half hour or more
before you gave the alarm. And you removed
your costume&mdash;the &lsquo;Dead Flower&rsquo; costume&mdash;which
you had worn out of the theater. You ...
you washed your hands and face&mdash;for there was no
make-up on you when I saw you in the vestibule....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="500" height="688" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>His arm had circled her as he talked, his voice
had grown warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francesca mia!&rdquo; he cried suddenly. He had
raised her to her feet, and drawn her passionately
against him. He spoke with his lips close to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I who am evil. Since that night you have
been an enigma luring me. I loved you before.
But now something else in me worships before
you. Oh, my adored one, my beautiful, cruel one.
Tell me ... I will love you more ... I will
share it with you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt her body stiffen as his arms tightened.
Under his burning eyes her face had grown white.
She stared at him with sudden horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;God in heaven!
You are mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francesca mia!&rdquo; he was shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her arms wrenched themselves free. For a
moment he held her writhing body. Then her
hand stung against his face. His head recoiled
under the blow. She stood apart from him, despair
and anguish on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear God, there is no one ... no one,&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes watched her aloofly as she sank
to the floor and lay sobbing and whimpering at his
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She acts,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;she acts....&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE HAUNTED ROOM</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which an apoplectic scientist explodes&mdash;In which invisible
footsteps sound in a dark corridor&mdash;In which
Julien De Medici opens a letter&mdash;The woman of the
hidden eyes&mdash;Floria, the lady of the dagger, appears&mdash;In
which underworlds collide&mdash;The staircase to Hell
and a strange passion&mdash;A voice that spoke over the
telephone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tall, wine-colored velvets fell in monotonous
parallels from the ceiling to the floor. There were
no windows to be seen. A somber and luxurious
emptiness like the inside of a jewel box stamped
the curious chamber.</p>
<p>Four black candlesticks ending in little pyramids
of flame stood on the long table in the center.
The four little flames glistened like suspended
medallions. The towering drapes that enclosed
the room broke the darkness into thin and motionless
waves. The shadows reaching toward the
burning candles seemed to beat with an invisible
and inaudible rhythm.</p>
<p>Julien De Medici, his narrow eyes half shut, sat
watching the dungeon lights that flitted over the
face of Dr. Lytton. The doctor&rsquo;s bald head loomed
ghostlike above the table. His black eyes were
peering wrathfully at his half visible host. He
was talking in a voice alive with indignation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring some lights into this confounded place.
This sort of thing is at the bottom of your trouble,
Julien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved his short hand in the air and a great
shadow lifted itself to the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deliberately submitting yourself to a
dangerous hypnosis. The wraiths of past De
Medicis! Inherited phantoms. Bosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist snorted and brought a fist down
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hypnosis, I tell you. A cleverly induced mania
as artificial as this damned room. Wake up, man.
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with you except a stupid,&mdash;yes,
sir, a damnably deliberate effort to make a
fool out of yourself. You&rsquo;re as sound mentally
as I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soft voice of De Medici came out of the
shadows. His choler growing, the doctor continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try crystal-gazing? Sitting in
a room like this, candlesticks, darkness, drapes,
and bombarding yourself with the fancy that
you&rsquo;re someone else! What do you expect? Something
is bound to happen if you keep it up long
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>The soft calm of De Medici&rsquo;s voice seemed to
infuriate his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you claim to be in love with Florence,&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Yet you haven&rsquo;t made a move to help
her. They&rsquo;ll close in on her any day now. We&rsquo;ve
got to do something. Come now, I want to talk
to you. Do you think her innocent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer her guilty,&rdquo; De Medici whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; the scientist grunted. He sat stroking
his heavy face. &ldquo;Monomania,&rdquo; he muttered as
if to himself. He raised his voice. &ldquo;What form
do these idiotic delusions of yours take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glaring into the shadows he waited for De
Medici&rsquo;s words. They came languidly out of the
darkness&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither delusion nor idiocy, Hugo. She unquestionably
murdered her father. And I find the
situation to my liking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton was on his feet. He walked swiftly
to the side of De Medici and seized his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to talk to you chiefly about her,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Ballau was my dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes remained intently on the shadowed
curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
been working hard. And you&rsquo;ve found out what
I know. You&rsquo;ve found it was Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you drag yourself out of your delusions
long enough to think sanely?&rdquo; the doctor cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;My mind is perfectly clear,&rdquo; De Medici answered.
He lighted a cigarette in the half dark,
his eyes watching the glow of the tobacco. &ldquo;You
have discovered that someone telephoned her at
the theater, that she was in the apartment more
than a half hour before giving the alarm. And
other details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, other details,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton repeated
warily. De Medici sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve interrupted a charming dream,&rdquo; he
said, rising from the chair. His hand passed
tiredly over his forehead. The scientist regarded
him closely. He saw the lean face of his host
shudder and the gleaming eyes close for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; continued De Medici in a murmur, &ldquo;it
comes over me like that. A dream obliterates me.
I sit and watch myself from a distance.&rdquo; He
smiled wearily at his friend. &ldquo;Are you interested
in my symptoms, Hugo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; the doctor answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;From a distance,&rdquo; repeated De Medici, &ldquo;my
gestures seem to change. They become slower.
And my jaw shifts curiously to a side. My eyes
droop and I keep staring out of their corners. The
fears leave me, however. There is nothing to
fear in this dream. Last night I sat there staring
at the curtains and waiting. But there was no
fear. And finally the hallucination came. As it
did once before on the night of the murder. I
was in the apartment and she appeared for an
instant in the doorway. The Francesca one ...
her hair down and a band circling her forehead.
I knew last night she would come again. And she
did. I sat looking at Florence&mdash;a Florence you
don&rsquo;t know.... Cold, cruel with a wild gleam to
her.... A long robe and a dagger in her hand.
She smiles at me and I feel my heart dissolve with
rapture. The dream is horrible and beautiful. An
exultation comes into me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you aware of its unreality at the
moment?&rdquo; Dr. Lytton asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, yes! I watch from a distance. I repeat
to myself&mdash;&lsquo;a hallucination.&rsquo; But even then there
is something truthful about her. Even though I
know I dream the image, it appears to me as psychologically
true. The woman with the dagger is
Florence....&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici moved slowly down the room.
As he stood against the darkened curtains, his face
glowed uncertainly toward the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must save her,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;if you can keep your head
clear of these obsessions of yours. Yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
paused and stared at De Medici. &ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he
resumed. &ldquo;It fits in. That vision of yours. Yes,
an odd psychological phenomenon. I have had
a similar image in my mind for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s voice had undergone a change when
he spoke again. It was crisp and with a precision
in its sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me, Hugo,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what you&rsquo;ve
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; countered the doctor, &ldquo;what are you
hiding? Your consciousness of her guilt is not as
pathologic as you would make out. The telephone
call and all the rest are good enough. But you
were there that night. The first to see her. You
saw something ... found something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded as the doctor&rsquo;s eyes glittered
at him. Moving to the table he opened a drawer
and removed the purse he had picked up in the
Ballau library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the chair near the body,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It
has her initials in the corner. And inside a theater
program for a performance of &lsquo;Iris&rsquo; in a
London theater in 1899.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton reached for the object with an
exclamation. His hands seized it and, thrusting
it into the light of the candles, he remained lost
in an ecstatic contemplation of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he muttered abruptly. &ldquo;I knew
it. Yes, I was right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici smiled slowly at the scientist&rsquo;s elation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;A brain,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It plays with a
delightful puzzle. He knows something.&rdquo; There
flitted through his mind the memory of Dr. Lytton&rsquo;s
accomplishments.... An exuberant modernist
among the pathologists of the country....
&ldquo;He came here to corroborate something,&rdquo; he
continued musing: &ldquo;He suspects that I and not
Florence did the murder. Yes, an obvious and
romantic theory. Even Norton played with it at
the inquest. I turned De Medici for a moment and
killed a man.... Inherited homicidal mania ...
hm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An odd thing about Ballau,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton was
saying. He had seated himself and was copying
something from the program. He talked cheerfully
as he wrote. &ldquo;A man like Ballau without a
breath of scandal about his name. Rather strange,
don&rsquo;t you think? A lover of beautiful things.
Unmarried, with no restrictions. And yet not the
sign of a woman or of an affair in his life. I&rsquo;ve
talked to a dozen people who knew him as well as
I did. All collaborate on a halo for the man. And
thereby hangs an idea. Virtue, no less than vice,
has its pathologic mainsprings, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes beamed excitedly over the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve names in the cast,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking them down. Names are always something.
A name is a beginning. Did you tell Florence
of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;And she grew excited,&rdquo; pursued Dr. Lytton
as he finished his writing. &ldquo;Did you mention
the Goldsmith Theater to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wanted the thing back, eh? Come, what
did she say? How did she look?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you said,&rdquo; De Medici answered. &ldquo;Excited.
Disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was before she left town?&rdquo; pursued Dr.
Lytton. &ldquo;Of course.... You saw her after the
inquest. She left that night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; De Medici murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton continued, &ldquo;she went to a
place called Rollo, in Maine. A curious out-of-the-way
little village. I found this out the next day.
She had had her trunks shipped there. The grief
and excitement, I suppose. And a desire to get
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; repeated De Medici uncomfortably.
So she had gone away! A bewilderment
came into his thought. He recalled her rage that
had ended their talk in the theater. The blow she
had struck and her anguish. Remorse and tenderness
overwhelmed him, and a feeling of self-revulsion.
What a scoundrel! Playing with evil
dreams while her heart was breaking. &ldquo;No one ...
no one,&rdquo; she had wailed. Yes, he had abandoned
her. Become a useless and fantastic actor in
the hour she needed him. And she had fled....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The tragedy suddenly changed in his inner
mind. The image of the evil Francesca which had
confused itself with his memories of Florence
seemed to evaporate from the recesses of his
thought. He saw, in retrospect suddenly, the
laughing-eyed, vivid young woman whom he had
loved. Guilty of the murder of her father! Incredible!
He had been playing viciously with a
dangerous make-believe. Yes, there was something
else. A mystery beckoned behind the inexplicable
conduct of the girl. He had succumbed
to a few obvious leads. Now, with his mind
cleared of the phantoms that had seduced him,
he remembered the dead man. Victor Ballau ...
there had been something about him. Trembling
fingers and averted eyes.... A secret pantomiming
behind the fastidious exterior.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton was talking. De Medici&rsquo;s ears again
picked up the man&rsquo;s excited ramblings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In part the mystery lies with Ballau. A London
theater program. You know he lived in London
before he came here. I found out something
about him. He was married in London. Have
you ever talked to Florence about her mother,
Julien? Never mind, we&rsquo;ll come to that later.
This purse fits in. I wanted only a peg to hang
the thing on. Here it is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton waved the paper on which he had
copied the names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names are mysteries in themselves....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>He paused and glanced quickly around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s knocking, Julien,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>A muffled sound was repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the door,&rdquo; De Medici smiled at the doctor&rsquo;s
unexpected nerves. &ldquo;Come in, Harding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harding, his bland-faced valet, entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A special-delivery letter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; De Medici took the proffered envelope.
The valet stepped through the curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton cried as De Medici&rsquo;s
fingers began to tear open the letter. &ldquo;Postmarks
are important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched De Medici&rsquo;s eyes grow narrow and
an expression of horror slowly consume his shadowed
face. He had removed a sheet of paper from
the envelope. The thing lay in his fingers and
cast a distorted shadow across the table. There
followed a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear God!&rdquo; the voice of De Medici came
softly. He had become rigid. His face had grown
into a somber and elongated mask. For the moment
he stood motionless, his eyes staring. Terror,
blank and wordless, gleamed in the look of
his eyes.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton sprang to his side. De Medici had
wavered and stumbled against the table edge.
His hand shot out, fingers spread, in a gesture of
horror toward the fluttering shadows on the curtains.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;She ... she!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;From the thing
with the dagger....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor stooped and picked up the paper
that had dropped from his hands. Holding it
quickly under the rays of the candles he read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Julien De Medici,</p>
<p>I write to let you know that your meddlesome interest
in my affairs is distasteful. You will allow the matter
to drop or incur the anger of one who knows how to deal
with a De Medici. I am,</p>
<p><span class="center">Your humble servant,</span>
<span class="jr"><span class="sc">Floria</span>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Underneath the signature was a crude drawing
in ink of a dagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Floria,&rdquo; muttered Dr. Lytton.</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s face, gray in the candle-light, was
regarding him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the postmark?&rdquo; the doctor asked
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rollo, Maine,&rdquo; De Medici answered. Dr. Lytton
examined the torn envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rollo, Maine,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;mailed yesterday
morning. Come now, pull yourself together,
Julien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is complete. It fits in. Hm, what
a curious handwriting. You recognize it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hers,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; the scientist murmured. &ldquo;Come,
the mystery draws to an end. I would like to make
comparisons. Have you a letter of hers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mechanically, De Medici opened the table
drawer. Dr. Lytton brought a candle close to its
contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. His eyes studied the
envelope. &ldquo;Written two months ago. Fine. Excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He removed a letter sheet and spread it under
the light. De Medici watched him. His calm had
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Floria and not Francesca,&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;Floria of the dagger. Then the hallucination
was not entirely unreal. He said something ...
what was it? A similar image in his brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart sickened as the realization grew.
Guilty! Yet a few moments ago a conviction had
overpowered him&mdash;a certainty that he was toying
with chimeras, that no truth or substance lay in
his evil obsessions. But now the letter ... and
the postmark....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;A similarity,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton finally announced.
&ldquo;The letter from Rollo, Maine, could have been
written by the same hand that wrote this letter to
you. Yet they are not identical. There are several
vital differences, although a layman, on cursory
examination, would call them of no consequence.
Yes, the difference is a difference of
tempo. Floria, the lady of the dagger, writes
with a certain jerky stiffiness. The characters
show high nervous tension, excitement, hysteria.
An exaggeration of her natural chirography.
Look, the lines are uneven. The letters jumble in
spots. The thing resembles the slow, painful
scrawl of a child. Yet it was written in fierce
haste.... Hysteria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded. His eyes avoided the thing
under the doctor&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceived it from the beginning,&rdquo; the scientist
continued. &ldquo;Everything pointed to it. A
dual personality....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence and Floria,&rdquo; murmured De Medici.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton&rsquo;s manner had become elate. A professional
singsong was in his voice. He was off
on a favorite topic once more. His heavy face
glistened with enthusiasm. The underworlds of
the soul ... the absorbing novelties of manias
... these were his scientific specialties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected one of two things out of my visit,&rdquo;
he announced. &ldquo;I knew what sort of creature
had killed Ballau.... It had left its marks in
every detail. An amazing murder.... A slow,
painful, and yet fiercely executed crime. Like the
handwriting on this letter paper. The eerie footprints
of hysteria. They were all over the deed.
A soul writhing in the depths of a crazed sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is quoting from his paper on somnambulism,&rdquo;
mused De Medici. His eyes remained
on the doctor&rsquo;s face. Lytton had settled back in
his chair. His wrathful and nervous manner had
given way to a pedagogic air. Yet as he talked
his eyes peered through the lowered lashes at the
immobile figure of De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dual personality was obvious, Julien.
But, ah, whose? And the obvious answer was&mdash;yours.
The dagger&mdash;a relic of De Medici evil.
The blood-stained hands. I learned this from
Norton. Florence&rsquo;s confusion. Her concealed
evidence. To protect you, of course. I talked to
her after you had taken her to the theater. You
remember, the inquest morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; De Medici whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad. You were mad. But I needed no diagnosis
from her. Mad you seemed. And very
clever, too clever at the inquest. A curious balance
of sincerity and evasion. And the two hours
between eight o&rsquo;clock and ten o&rsquo;clock that night he
was killed. Where had you spent them? Yes, a
walk in Broadway. But you never walk, my dear
Julien. Do I remember correctly? The purse
gave me my first definite conviction, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now your theory is?&rdquo; De Medici
prompted him quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letter has ended it,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton replied.
&ldquo;Florence Ballau and not Julien De Medici.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I may have written it myself,&rdquo; De Medici
murmured; &ldquo;written it, sent it from Rollo, Maine
... to myself ... evidence to exonerate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that,&rdquo; smiled Dr. Lytton. &ldquo;Except
that you couldn&rsquo;t have known I would be here
tonight. The letter is authentic. And the rest
unravels itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He beamed at the masked eyes of his host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dual personality, as we know it,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;is a dramatic disease. Yes, the phenomenon
of disassociation.... People are seldom born
with dual personalities except in the most neurotic
of cases. Ordinarily they acquire them. In
pathology, dual personality cases belong to the ill-defined
border-land between sanity and insanity.
It is for that reason that I have been inclined to
ridicule your own obsessions, Julien. Dual personalities
are not inherited. Bad blood may breed
disorders. But the charming Jekyll and Hyde
pose you have been trying to wish on yourself
is, scientifically, absurd. Are you interested,
Julien?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men sat facing each other out of the
shadows of the velvet-hung room. The candles
burned motionlessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember a case of a woman named Jenny,&rdquo;
Dr. Lytton mused aloud. &ldquo;Do you mind sitting
closer so I can see you, Julien? It&rsquo;s rather difficult
talking to an apparition. Thanks.... Now
we&rsquo;ll discuss the strange case of Florence Ballau.
I&rsquo;ll give you the groundwork. We&rsquo;ll be able to
operate in the open, then. And I shall need your
help. Yes, you can help me, Julien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; De Medici muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Jenny,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton resumed. &ldquo;Well,
she was the mother of a three-year-old boy who,
while playing, slipped out of the window of their
flat. As she came walking back from the grocery
store, Jenny looked up. She saw her child hanging
by his fingers from the window four stories
above the ground. She stood powerless and transfixed
while his little fingers slowly gave way. She
watched him slip ... slip, and then his body shot
to the ground and was smashed to a pulp before
her eyes. And here we have a logical cause for
dual personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shock was terrific for the mother. It split
her mind. And an abnormal condition developed.
Her little son fell to his death eight years ago and
Jenny is now in an asylum. I&rsquo;ve studied her carefully.
She is the ideal dual personality case. You
see, Julien, nothing inherited, no phantoms, no
mysterious impulses. Merely a shock that split
the mind into two compartments. She presents
the following symptoms. She will be engaged, for
instance, in sewing or in conversation. Suddenly
she ceases her work. She stands up. Her eyes
lift. And for the minutes that follow she lives
over again the awful scene of her little son&rsquo;s
death, carrying out in every detail the tragedy of
the thing. And during the minutes the hallucination
endures she goes through the scene with
all the power of an accomplished emotional actress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve watched her. While this drama is
in progress she is perfectly unconscious of the
actual things happening around her. She hears
nothing that is said and sees nothing but the imaginary
scene which she is reliving. This phenomenon,
which is technically called somnambulism,
will end as suddenly as it begins, and Jenny will
return to her former occupation, absolutely unaware
of the fact that it has been interrupted.
You see how different your alleged and artificial
case of fancied obsession is, Julien. You remember
too much. The vision of Francesca is in your
mind now&mdash;the thing you fancied you saw. Therefore
you are not a victim of disassociation. If
you&rsquo;re a man of evil at all, it is you who sit here
and not a hidden, unknown you that walks in the
dark places of your subconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton leaned forward and placed his hand
on De Medici&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Jenny is questioned during her apparently
normal intervals,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will be found that
she has not only entirely forgotten everything
that happened during her somnambulism, but that
the whole tragedy of her boy&rsquo;s death has completely
disappeared from her conscious mind. She
remembers nothing of the minutes she stood
watching her son slipping from the window ledge.
And if you press her she&rsquo;ll discuss his death
vaguely and indifferently as if it were the death of
someone else&rsquo;s child. She&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Oh, he just died,
that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; And reveal no interest or emotion
whatsoever. Yet concerning all other things of her
past life she has a rather keen memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This curious localized loss of memory or amnesia
is found in some cases. In other dual personality
cases we have a complete loss of memory
of all events preceding the shock that produced
the disassociation. So you see, science
absolves you, Julien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we come to Florence Ballau. A high-strung,
vivid temperament,&rdquo; continued Dr. Lytton.
&ldquo;The letter signed Floria and decorated
with the dagger reveals one thing. Its writer is
suffering from delusions of persecution. Persecutory
delusions are a common form of mental
disorder. We all have them more or less. Floria
is the terrified and persecuted thing that dwells
in the soul of Florence Ballau. At times this terrified
thing usurps the body of Miss Ballau and
lives its own mysterious life. As in the case of
Jenny it is not an inherited phenomenon. It was
induced by shock of some sort. Florence may be
dimly aware of the change after she returns to
herself. More likely, however, she is merely distracted,
depressed, and suffers from a sense of
bewilderment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>De Medici nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember something,&rdquo; he said slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would,&rdquo; smiled Dr. Lytton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had called at her apartment unexpectedly.
It was last year. I rang the bell a half dozen
times before anyone answered. Finally the door
was opened by Florence. I hardly recognized her.
She stood before me white-faced and eyes staring.
I had a feeling for the moment that something
terrible had happened, was happening. I tried to
pass it over&mdash;such things always confuse me violently&mdash;by
inviting myself in for a cup of tea. She
stood looking at me almost as if she failed to recognize
me. Then she said, &lsquo;Father isn&rsquo;t home,&rsquo;
and closed the door in my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; murmured the doctor. &ldquo;The perfect
corroboration. And did you ever ask her
what had been wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She called me up,&rdquo; De Medici answered, &ldquo;the
next morning, and apologized for the incident.
She said she suffered from periodic headaches the
pain of which almost drove her beside herself. I
had come on her during one of the spells.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did she use the word &lsquo;spells&rsquo;?&rdquo; Dr. Lytton
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she did,&rdquo; De Medici answered.</p>
<p>The two men became silent. The candles had
burned down. One of them sputtered excitedly
for a moment and then faded out. De Medici&rsquo;s
eyes watched the growing flicker of the three
lights. Darkness would come.... His heart
chilled. Florence, crazed and standing dagger in
hand before her father.... Victor Ballau staring
aghast at the horrible-eyed woman who wore
the body of his daughter but in whose soul leaped
the awful desires of a demoniacal stranger ...
the lady of the dagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is explained,&rdquo; he mused as the second
candle drifted away. The darkness stepped
closer to the two men. &ldquo;The beard ... the thing
he clutched....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I follow your thoughts,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Lytton
from behind his hand. &ldquo;The false Vandyke....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; De Medici said. The two remaining
candles were dying. A terror swept him. Darkness
... it would grow black. There were candles
in the table drawer. His hands crept slowly
forward and stopped. An inanition held them.
He sat riveted, unable to stir. Terror exploded a
Roman candle in his head....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he breathed, a sweat covering him.
Darkness! A black room. His throat framed a
cry.... &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he moaned.</p>
<p>Hands were pressing him down, holding him
against the chair. Something was at his throat.
No, inside his throat, crawling into his mouth.
Suddenly his arms flung themselves against the
air. He plunged to his feet, beating at the blackness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lights ... lights!&rdquo; came in a scream from
his throat. The doctor&rsquo;s voice roared a command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand still!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure of De Medici spun crazily in the
darkness and crashed into the velvet-covered wall.
It sank without sound to the floor. The doctor
groped toward the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julien!&rdquo; he cried. His thick fingers were
fumbling with a match box. He held a quickly
lighted candle aloft. The curtained room swayed
and danced in the shadows.... A figure lay,
face down, arms outstretched and fingers spread
against the gigantic-seeming drape.</p>
<p>The telephone was ringing. Its bell tinkled
eerily in the dark. Dr. Lytton stood listening. A
voice was waiting for him. He stepped forward
and lifted the receiver from its hook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. De Medici?&rdquo; a voice asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the doctor answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Lieutenant Norton on the wire, Mr.
De Medici. Can you come over to my office at
once?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to go into any detail over the
phone,&rdquo; the voice answered. &ldquo;But I would like
to see you as soon as possible. We&rsquo;ve found the
murderer of Mr. Ballau.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In which Nemesis babbles cheerfully&mdash;In which the
Dead Flower adopts new petals&mdash;Postmarks and timetables
and a false beard that sneers mischievously&mdash;Also
a scrawl of vengeance, enigmatic ashes and a half
signature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cab rolled through the dark streets. Dr.
Lytton&rsquo;s hand rested on the knee of his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>De Medici nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dizziness,&rdquo; he answered laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rather interesting case,&rdquo; the doctor looked
at him speculatively. &ldquo;Fear, eh? Morbid and
illogical fear. Hm. Nothing simpler. Phobias
are easy to trace. You fainted. Fainting is an
escape from overwhelming impulses that are repugnant
to the conscious mind. You had an impulse....&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He prowls around like a blind weasel,&rdquo; he
mused as the scientist talked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Obvious. Why not discuss it?&rdquo; Dr.
Lytton was saying. &ldquo;Such things must be considered
impersonally. Your impulse was to murder
me, Julien. Darkness, candles, long velvet
curtains&mdash;these things fascinate you because they
are symbols of desires that hide in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; he spoke as the cab stopped
before a lighted building.</p>
<p>They entered the police station arm in arm. De
Medici&rsquo;s legs still felt weak. A man in police uniform
conducted them to Lieutenant Norton&rsquo;s office.
The lieutenant rose to greet them. De
Medici noted the look of triumph which kindled
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come right in,&rdquo; cried the detective exuberantly.
&ldquo;Glad to see you, Mr. De Medici.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded somewhat less enthusiastically at
the stocky figure of Dr. Lytton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;you do, doctor?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>De Medici sat down beside the lieutenant&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve found the murderer?&rdquo; he asked
quietly. &ldquo;In which case you must have changed
your mind about Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, sit down, doctor,&rdquo; Norton beamed,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll apologize for a lot of things. Have a
cigar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitors declined. Dr. Lytton, regarding
the red-faced detective, mused silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s stumbled on something. An intelligent
man, but clumsy and superficial,&rdquo; he was thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Norton seemed to expand in his chair. His face
glowed with delight as he began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I owe you my
first apology for pretending to you I thought Victor
Ballau had killed himself. I was absolutely
convinced it was a murder on the night we found
the body. I had the impression of suicide for a
few minutes. But before ten minutes had passed
investigation showed me that there were a number
of things not to be explained by the suicide theory.
Well, gentlemen, realizing that the murder was an
intricate one and that it would take a great deal of
care to unravel the mystery, I adopted the suicide
theory as a ruse and instructed my force to take
a similar attitude. We harped on this theory at
the inquest. You see, it was my purpose to throw
the criminal off the track and make the capture a
bit easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvelous,&rdquo; murmured De Medici. The lieutenant&rsquo;s
na&iuml;vet&eacute; had suddenly amused him. &ldquo;A
bewildering deception. And you got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton grinned at the man&rsquo;s banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her,&rdquo; he corrected. &ldquo;Miss Florence Ballau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under lock and key,&rdquo; said Norton. &ldquo;We arrested
her yesterday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; whispered De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In New York,&rdquo; Norton answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes closed happily. In New York
yesterday morning ... and the letter from Rollo,
Maine, had been mailed yesterday morning....
Two conflicting incidents. He laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think Miss Ballau committed the
murder?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;The theory is as bewildering,
if not as charming, as your first, lieutenant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton nodded in good humor and lighted a
cigar. Dr. Lytton sat regarding De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mailed yesterday from Rollo, Maine,&rdquo; the
scientist mused, &ldquo;and she was arrested yesterday
in New York. Then she either left the thing with
a friend to mail for her, or....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes gleamed for an instant and an excited
smile curved his heavy lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case turned out much simpler than we
actually expected,&rdquo; continued Norton. &ldquo;We got
our first clew within a few hours after the murder.
We found out Miss Ballau had received a telephone
call at the theater at 9:30 on the night of
the crime. The stage manager had called her to
the phone. He stood within hearing distance while
she talked. He heard her say something like,
&lsquo;Yes ... yes. Oh, God!&rsquo; And he noticed she
was upset when she hung up. She told him she
felt sick. He tried to argue with her but she
dashed out of the theater without changing her
costume or taking the paint off her face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;A revelation,&rdquo; murmured De Medici. His
spirits seemed to have risen as the detective
talked. Dr. Lytton sat with his lips pursed, dividing
his attention between the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you knew about the telephone call,&rdquo;
Norton went on good-naturedly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
blame you for trying to shield the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gallant,&rdquo; sighed De Medici. &ldquo;Thanks. Go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed Norton, &ldquo;we finally located
the cabby who had driven her home. This took a
few hours, but when we got him he remembered
her well, owing to the fact she had her make-up
and costume on and acted queer and excited. She
got into his cab outside the theater and drove to
the Ballau apartment, giving him a dollar tip in
advance and telling him to go as fast as he could.
Her contention at the inquest was that she reached
the apartment about half-past ten. From the
stage manager&rsquo;s evidence and the cabby&rsquo;s statement
it is obvious that she got home about a quarter
to ten the latest. If she&rsquo;d stopped at all between
the telephone call and entering the cab
she&rsquo;d have removed her make-up and taken her
hat or a wrap of some kind. We know she didn&rsquo;t.
Our investigations in the Ballau home resulted in
finding a towel in the linen basket off Miss Ballau&rsquo;s
room. The towel was smeared with rouge
and lampblack. We found out that the basket
had been emptied that afternoon by the laundryman.
Therefore the towel with the rouge and
lampblack on it was placed there during that
day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your deductions are invulnerable,&rdquo; De Medici
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll discuss them more fully later,&rdquo; Norton
countered, his good humor remaining under the
derision of his visitor. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem convinced
that Miss Ballau is guilty?&rdquo; He smiled
in turn.</p>
<p>De Medici shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite his good humor,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
uncertain of something. The theory has a hole in
it.... Or he wouldn&rsquo;t be telling me. Or perhaps
it&rsquo;s another one of his brilliant ruses....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll discuss them more fully later,&rdquo; Norton
continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the trouble of outlining
the case to you because I think you can help me
on several points. For instance, this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective opened a cupboard at the side of
his desk and removed a bundle. Unwrapping it,
a woman&rsquo;s gown was revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen this before?&rdquo; Norton
asked.</p>
<p>De Medici regarded the gown without moving....
A costume, nineteenth century ... Italian,
flashed through his mind. Her costume in &ldquo;The
Dead Flower&rdquo;! No....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see you recognize it,&rdquo; Norton said. &ldquo;Miss
Ballau&rsquo;s dress in your show, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici picked up the thing and spread it
out. No, not hers. He smiled inwardly. The certainty
had come to him that the detective had
bungled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; Norton continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to trap any evidence from you. We found
this dress on the fire escape outside the window
of the Ballau library. This dress and&rdquo;&mdash;he
stopped, opened a drawer in his desk&mdash;&ldquo;and this
crucifix. Do you recognize it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; murmured De Medici involuntarily. It
was the gift he had made Florence to wear with
the &ldquo;Dead Flower&rdquo; costume&mdash;an oddly designed
cross of ebony backed with silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Norton smiled. &ldquo;The dress and the
cross were together. But to go on. There are a
number of vital points. For instance, Miss Ballau
testified that Jane, the housekeeper, let her in
that night. We&rsquo;ve questioned the housekeeper
secretly. She&rsquo;s a simple-minded woman. After
some grilling we discovered that she did not let
Miss Ballau into the apartment and that the first
she knew of that young lady&rsquo;s presence in the
house was the sound of her screaming. And this
screaming, you will bear in mind, came fully
thirty to thirty-five minutes after Miss Ballau arrived
home. On pressing Jane further, we discovered
that Miss Ballau had pleaded with her as
a vital personal favor on which her life depended,
to say that she had let her in at the time and in
the manner they both swore to at the coroner&rsquo;s
inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>Dr. Lytton cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have police witnesses to the housekeeper&rsquo;s
confession?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and several witnesses not of the police,&rdquo;
Norton answered. &ldquo;Meyerson was present,
and a man named Carvello. But let me go on.
We found the key to the apartment in Miss Ballau&rsquo;s
purse the night of the murder. I looked for
it myself and, on finding it, left it there. Miss
Ballau, you will remember, testified she had lost
the key some weeks before. Which explained why
she had to ring the bell to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things are hardly sufficient for the arrest
of Miss Ballau,&rdquo; De Medici said quietly as
the detective paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree,&rdquo; said Norton. &ldquo;All this was
evidence we had within two days of the murder.
We didn&rsquo;t act on it but continued our hunt for
more. More was necessary and we waited till
we got it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;The motive, for instance,&rdquo; smiled Norton.
&ldquo;Well, three days after the inquest, or two days,
I think, Miss Ballau disappeared. We had been
watching her closely but she managed to elude us.
I put two of my best men in pursuit of her and I
devoted my own time to finding out her history.
I was able to discover through documents and inquiry
that Florence Ballau was not Victor Ballau&rsquo;s
daughter but his stepdaughter. She was a
year old when Ballau married her mother in London.
As you see, this supplies the beginnings of a
motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through De Medici&rsquo;s mind passed a suddenly
illuminated memory of Victor Ballau&mdash;the Ballau
whose fingers had trembled as he poured the
liqueur that night, whose eyes had turned away
as he toasted the happiness of his prospective
son-in-law. His heart grew heavy as the innuendo
of the lieutenant unfolded its logical terminations
before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would like to have your theory of the motive,&rdquo;
Dr. Lytton prompted the smiling detective.
&ldquo;Motives, of course, are always more interesting
and more important than clews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were to be married,&rdquo; Norton resumed,
turning to De Medici. &ldquo;And Ballau was jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; murmured De Medici. He sat staring
at the man. Words suddenly danced excitedly in
his head. &ldquo;The thing is mad,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
let a preposterous notion run away with you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton&rsquo;s arm reached toward his friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come here to listen, not to argue,&rdquo; he
cautioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; De Medici sighed. His face resumed
its mask of calm and interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Norton answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to
go into this. But there&rsquo;s nothing to be gained
now by not facing the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton smiled. &ldquo;The facts
are what we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The facts are that Mr. Ballau more than anyone
else desired the match,&rdquo; De Medici spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or seemed to,&rdquo; Norton interrupted. &ldquo;But on
the night that the engagement was to have been
announced he quite changed his mind about the
desirability of the match. And he played his
trump card with the girl. It was Ballau who telephoned
her at the theater at half-past nine. This
was a very easy fact to establish. The telephone
girl of the Hudson Apartments remembered distinctly,
and we have no reason to doubt her word,
that Mr. Ballau asked her to get his daughter on
the phone at the Galt Theater. Her memorandum
pad of outgoing calls contains the notation, &lsquo;Ballau&mdash;Columbus
2600. 9:28.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton interrupted,
&ldquo;that the notation refers to an outgoing call? It
may have been Miss Ballau who telephoned her
father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Norton shook his head. &ldquo;There are
three items of evidence bearing on the point. One
is the testimony of the telephone girl. Another
is the fact that Cort, the stage manager, summoned
Miss Ballau to the phone, and the third is
the memorandum pad itself. The call appears
listed in the column marked &lsquo;Outgoing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton leaned back in his chair, his face grown
serious and aloof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come now to the hour of the murder,&rdquo; he
resumed. &ldquo;Ballau telephoned his stepdaughter.
It was his last known act before his death. And
the answer to our mystery lies in the answer to
the question, &lsquo;What did Victor Ballau say to his
stepdaughter at half-past nine on the night of
April 10th?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective&rsquo;s dramatic utterance irritated De
Medici. He sat frowning and following in silence
the man&rsquo;s theory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Norton was saying, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll remember
that a week or so before his death Ballau had
made a new will leaving all his money to the girl.
Why? Because he loved her. He had loved her
for a long time. The will was made in her presence.
It was a plea for her. But it failed. There&rsquo;s
no question but that he fought with her continually
on this subject&mdash;his love for her. Yes, and
her past love for him. He pleaded and threatened
in turn. He was an old man and old men are
sometimes given to strange passions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, when there was nothing else left,
when the time had come to surrender her publicly
to you, he lost his head. He called her up. Get
this man Ballau, now, gentlemen, upset by his infatuation
for the girl, preparing for the hour when
he must surrender all hope of her, mixed up,
crazy. And he telephones her. He can&rsquo;t stand it
any longer. He tells her over the phone that he
must see her. She answers evasively, &lsquo;Yes ...
yes.&rsquo; And he goes on pleading. And finally he
plays his trump card. He tells her unless she renounces
De Medici he&rsquo;ll expose the relations that
have existed between them&mdash;between Ballau and
his supposed daughter. Relations, let us say, before
you entered her life, Mr. De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he was going to do this thing publicly.
It was a cowardly act. But, mind you, the sort of
threat a man of his age driven to despair by his
infatuation would make. And she rushed home.
There were yet two hours to ward off the thing he
threatened. She rushed home, beside herself, to
appeal to his better side, to plead with him and
weep and entreat him. The disgrace he had
threatened her with on the eve of her engagement
party was enough to make any young woman go
wild. You can imagine what followed as easily as
I can,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;her pleading, his excitement,
her tears, his offers, and, disgrace staring
her in the face, her hysteria and the murder.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>Dr. Lytton regarded De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s head was lowered. His narrow
eyes, half closed, were contemplating the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered softly. &ldquo;A persuasive
cock and bull story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton grew irritable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called you here to see if you would assist
me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to know how she acted the
morning you proposed to her. Did she say anything
about Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered De Medici, &ldquo;except that
she knew he would be overjoyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton nodded and looked grim. De Medici,
studying the floor, was thinking. &ldquo;She was nervous.
Yes, I remember something ... about Ballau.
Her manner changed. She asked what he
had said ... two or three times. And she wept
when I left her.... White-faced and weeping in
front of the theater.... Preposterous! Not
Florence. There&rsquo;s something else. This creature
paws clumsily with surfaces....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice of Dr. Lytton interrupted his musings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t finished, I hope,&rdquo; the doctor
smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. A few more things,&rdquo; Norton answered
testily. &ldquo;They may interest you. The scene of
the crime, eh? The disorder and the mysterious
props? Well, the murder suddenly committed&mdash;committed
during a moment of despair and passion&mdash;the
young woman stood beside the body of
the man she had killed and some sort of a notion
of planting evidence to throw the police off the
track came into her head. A notion typical of the
woman who has spent her life in the theater.
You&rsquo;ll remember she was beside herself at this
moment, that whatever she did in the half hour
following the slaying of Ballau would naturally
be the things an innocent and imaginative woman,
and not a hardened criminal, would do in an effort
to cover up the crime. She began to tear things
and overthrow things. She went about it bewilderedly.
Her idea was to make it seem as if a
terrific struggle had taken place so that suspicion
would not fall on a woman but on some powerful
assailant. But you saw yourself how she bungled
it in her distraction. The books, curtains, pictures:
the crucifix and the candle&mdash;all unconvincing.
The table idiotically set as for a supper
for two. All things that a distracted, imaginative
and hysterical young woman with a theatrical
training would do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; breathed Dr. Lytton. &ldquo;Your
psychology stands on firm ground. We might
even go a step further. We might even say that
a very clever murderer or murderess would have
arranged that scene not to give the police false
clews for a crime, but to make it seem as if Ballau
had killed himself&mdash;and arranged the entire scene
to convince the police a crime had not been committed.
She might have figured out something of
that nature, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought of that,&rdquo; Norton said slowly,
&ldquo;but I doubt it. She hadn&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton objected, &ldquo;unless the
murder was committed as soon as she entered the
room. Or, let us say, before....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton looked indignantly at the scientist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The theory doesn&rsquo;t impress you despite the
evidence?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be more impressed and certainly more
interested,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton answered, &ldquo;if your theories
included the presence of the false beard that
was found in Ballau&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Norton nodded and opened the
drawer of his desk again. He removed a large
manila envelope. The humorous-looking false
Vandyke, reminiscent of the slapstick methods of
stage comedians, lay exposed on his desk. Dr.
Lytton stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I look at this?&rdquo; he asked. The lieutenant
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm, I thought so,&rdquo; the doctor murmured.
Taking a note-book from his pocket, he wrote
down a few words. Norton raised his brows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;With your permission, lieutenant,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton
looked at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m merely recording the
fact, which I don&rsquo;t think has been recorded, for
it doesn&rsquo;t quite fit in with your ingenious theorizings,
that this beard is the product of a man
named Lenvier&mdash;a well-known London wig-maker.
You can read his name on the label here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective scowled. His amiability seemed
to have finally abandoned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; went on Dr. Lytton, &ldquo;I am, for
reasons entirely apart from the crime or its possible
perpetrator, interested to know how you explain
the presence of this beard in the dead man&rsquo;s
hand. Also the gum mucilage which you yourself
so ably discovered on his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing difficult about that,&rdquo; Norton answered.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a minor point. Ballau put the
thing on himself before his stepdaughter arrived.
He was seen wearing it by the housekeeper. But
he didn&rsquo;t show himself for purposes of disguise.
He was evidently caught with it on by her unawares.
She testified, you remember, that she
got only a glimpse of him. You&rsquo;ll recall that Ballau
summoned the girl to tell her that unless of
her own accord she renounced her intention of
marrying De Medici, he&rsquo;d expose her that night
... to disgrace. You can easily imagine that his
purpose in calling her to come to him was not
merely a desire to tell her what he was going to
do. He also had the hope of being able to induce
her to return to him ... of winning her back, in
other words. This man&rsquo;s brain is not at its clearest
and his sense of the fitness of things isn&rsquo;t at
its best at that moment. And he does something
which may appeal to you gentleman as ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;As long as it explains the beard,&rdquo; murmured
the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; snapped Norton, &ldquo;as long as it explains
the beard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared with indignation at the offensive-looking
bit of false hair on his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ballau put it on that night,&rdquo; he announced
savagely, &ldquo;because he imagined it made him look
handsomer and younger. He&rsquo;d been an actor in
his youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici stared with incredulous eyes at the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Are you
mad, lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Norton&rsquo;s reddish face glittered wrathfully
at him, De Medici suddenly laughed.... So this
was the police theory! Quite a respectable theory
of its sort, but bristling incongruously with false
Vandykes. Yes, a Vandyke, a humorously homeless
Vandyke knocked in vain for admittance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I said,&rdquo; Norton added sourly, &ldquo;the point
is of minor importance. If you don&rsquo;t like that
theory there&rsquo;s another. The false beard was
placed in the dead man&rsquo;s hand by Miss Ballau
and the mucilage added. A part of her camouflage
to put us on a wrong scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton smiled, &ldquo;except that,
if I recall, the dead man was clutching the thing.
His fingers had to be unfastened. However, we
may pass over this point, as you say.&rdquo; The doctor
chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one moment, if you please,&rdquo; Norton
cried, &ldquo;before you laugh too heartily. I expect
Miss Ballau&rsquo;s confession by morning. In the
meantime you may be interested in the circumstances
of her arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had grown heavily sarcastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that Miss Ballau eluded us,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;a few days after the inquest. But my men
picked up her trail again two days ago. She had
hidden herself in a cheap rooming-house district.
We watched her closely. She remained secluded
for a day without emerging once. But yesterday
morning she left her rooming house. She went
straight to the Ballau apartment. She was heavily
veiled and escaped the doorman&rsquo;s attention.
She went up in the elevator and let herself in with
the key. Michaelson of my staff was on guard in
the apartment. He&rsquo;d been there since the night
of the murder&mdash;waiting. He heard Miss Ballau
enter and, unseen by her, watched her. He followed
her down the hall and saw her enter her
bedroom. But she was almost too quick for him.
Before he was able to get to her, she had lighted
a candle and set fire to a letter taken from her
bureau drawer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The detective paused and, with a return of his
former composure, extracted a small envelope
from the manila wrapper on his desk. From the
envelope he carefully removed the fragments of a
piece of charred letter paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michaelson managed to save this,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>De Medici and the doctor arose and stared at
the burned fragment. All that was visible was
the last line of what evidently had been a short
letter. The line read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I warn you I am desperate....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beneath the line was part of the signature.
The flame had burned away all but the letters
F-l-o-r....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Floria,&rdquo; murmured De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; announced the detective, &ldquo;Florence
Ballau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raising his voice, he added to an aide in the
doorway:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring Miss Ballau in here....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>

<br /><span class="h2line2">THE HIDDEN VOICE</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which a scientist half opens a reluctant door&mdash;The
strange sleep of Florence Ballau&mdash;The broken murmur&mdash;&ldquo;It
was ... it was ...&rdquo;&mdash;In which a detective
scratches his ear and sighs&mdash;In which Julien De
Medici puts on his armor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;May I examine this?&rdquo; Dr. Lytton asked as the
aide walked out of the lieutenant&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton and De Medici studied the bit of
charred paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady of the dagger,&rdquo; the doctor spoke
softly. De Medici nodded, and the lieutenant concealed
a growing curiosity behind an official indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Dr. Lytton, &ldquo;the same hand
that wrote &lsquo;Floria.&rsquo; The script is identical.&rdquo;
He raised his voice. &ldquo;I presume,&rdquo; he inquired,
&ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve established the fact this is Miss Ballau&rsquo;s
handwriting, lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton nodded comfortably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve gone into that at
some length. We&rsquo;ve compared it with specimens
of Miss Ballau&rsquo;s normal handwriting. The similarity
is obvious. Miss Ballau has two different
handwritings. One of them a normal hand. The
other&mdash;this. Our experts tell me that the writing
here is indicative of a high emotional tension, almost
fury, and that its resemblance to Miss Ballau&rsquo;s
normal hand is unmistakable. Dr. Greer is
of the opinion that it&rsquo;s the handwriting either of
a drug addict or a person suffering from periodic
insanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Lytton. De Medici
raised his eyes suddenly.</p>
<p>Framed in the doorway stood the pale, silent
figure of Florence Ballau. De Medici sprang to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>She regarded him with an intent smile. He
seized her hand and his eyes searched her face.
An inscrutable pallor, a defiant and guarded
gleam, these he observed instantly. But behind
the unyielding pride of the young woman he perceived
a confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fear, not fear,&rdquo; repeated itself swiftly
in his thought. &ldquo;Then she is innocent. It&rsquo;s something
else. Grief, apprehension....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He murmured her name again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence, do you forgive me for the thing I
said in the theater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head moved imperceptibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>The dulled voice echoed miserably in his ears.
Pity and love overcame his tongue. He continued
to look at her in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suffering ... suffering,&rdquo; whispered itself in
his thought. He noted that she had turned her
eyes to the detective. A bustling little matron in
white stood behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Ballau,&rdquo; Norton addressed
her. &ldquo;Will you sit down, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lowered herself into a chair, her gestures
preoccupied as if her wits were sleeping. Dr.
Lytton had neither moved nor spoken. He sat
now facing her, his eyes gleaming with a curious
avidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told Mr. De Medici,&rdquo; began Norton.
&ldquo;He knows our whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; De Medici smiled at her, &ldquo;a charming
and impossible tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have changed your mind, Julien?&rdquo;
she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have, as they say in
the melodramas, unshaken faith in your innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he took her hand and his voice grew deep
with assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a reason, Florence,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;for
a perfect and impregnable reason. Because&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>He paused, aware of Dr. Lytton&rsquo;s restraining
frown. He had been about to speak of the letter
from Rollo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me as much or as little as you wish,&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;Lieutenant Norton&rsquo;s theories....&rdquo; He
shrugged his shoulders and smiled politely toward
the detective. &ldquo;Preposterous,&rdquo; he finished.</p>
<p>Florence looked at him, her eyes dulled. She
seemed to hear vaguely what he said. Fatigue
and anguish appeared to have reduced her to a
condition of semiconsciousness. Yet, behind the
ivory mask of her face, her emotions were tearing
at her senses. Her fingers moved spasmodically
in her lap, her lips twitched, and the taut posture
of her shoulders seemed to hold a hidden scream.
Dr. Lytton leaned slowly forward and took her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to talk to you,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice.</p>
<p>She moved her hand tiredly over her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; the pathologist demanded
quietly. &ldquo;And sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici frowned. Hypnosis! The doctor
was placing her under a sleep. His gleaming eyes
were fastened unwaveringly on the face of the
weary, anguish-ridden girl.</p>
<p>Norton raised his hand to object.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;A confession will be easy ... if there is one
to be gotten,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton anticipated him. Lowering
his voice, he repeated the word, &ldquo;sleep ...
sleep....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The figure of Florence Ballau underwent a
curious change. The tension of her body slowly
relaxed. Her eyes that had veiled the wildness
of her thought grew large, calm and centered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep,&rdquo; murmured Dr. Lytton. The three
men sat looking at her with amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in a hypnotic state,&rdquo; continued the doctor.
&ldquo;It was easy to put her to sleep. Her consciousness
was already almost spent and exhausted
with the struggle in her. And now,&rdquo; he
continued, facing the detective, &ldquo;we can put the
dual personality theory to a test. Not an infallible
one. But a convincing one. It is almost impossible
to obtain admissions from a hypnotized
subject concerning crimes or sins openly committed.
Because the mind which conceived and
enjoyed these crimes and sins is usually the conscious
mind. And it is this conscious mind which
now sleeps in Miss Ballau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, still staring at her, &ldquo;if the
crime is committed by a usurper, if murder is
done by the masked stranger, the subconscious
mind, then it is sometimes simple. I&rsquo;ll talk to her
now. Not to Florence Ballau but to the other
thing&mdash;the other personality, if there is one, that
lives in the underworld of her soul. Miss Ballau
is asleep. A door opens inside her and a furtive
stranger steps out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>His hand rested on her shoulder. He had risen
and was leaning over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who you are?&rdquo; he asked softly.</p>
<p>The rigid lips of the subject parted and moved
as if operated by marionette strings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Tell us your name....&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name?&rdquo; repeated Dr. Lytton tensely.
&ldquo;She hesitates,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You see.
There&rsquo;s another name to come.... She hesitates....
A wary creature, this thing....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s face swayed against the back of the
chair. A moaning sound came from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acting,&rdquo; mused De Medici slowly as his eyes
watched her. &ldquo;She pretends. She is awake,
alive. She hesitates, uncertain what to do, what
course to follow. Why? Ah, something to confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thought grew confused. She was acting,
pretending a hypnoidal state and talking
shrewdly, falling into the monotone familiar to
the stage as denoting &ldquo;trance condition.&rdquo; De
Medici felt convinced of this. Her monotone had
betrayed her. At least, as her first words came
he recalled instantly that this was the voice she
had used in the part she had played a year ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I may be wrong,&rdquo; he thought swiftly.
&ldquo;If it was real, if she were actually under hypnosis,
her subconscious would utilize an easy voice&mdash;a
voice without inflections or nuances and easy
for its unaccustomed energies to operate....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you think of your name?&rdquo; pressed Dr.
Lytton. Her lips began again to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flor ... Flor ...&rdquo; they pronounced....
&ldquo;Florence Ballau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A censorship operates,&rdquo; murmured the pathologist.
&ldquo;The conscious mind lies on the
threshold of this door and prevents it from opening.
But she hesitated. A significant fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes held the wide, centered eyes of his
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the night your stepfather
was killed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The lips parted and answered slowly, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell the truth?&rdquo; Dr. Lytton whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth,&rdquo; repeated itself from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the murder of your stepfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shuddered. Her eyes moved as if they were
struggling. Her hands quivered in her lap. But
her lips remained firm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;The truth,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton whispered close to her.
&ldquo;Tell me the truth. There is nothing to fear.
I&rsquo;m your friend. I demand that you tell me what
happened. Did you kill Victor Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the lips moaned. &ldquo;I came ... I came
in....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl swayed in the chair and the sentence
remained unfinished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton spoke gently. He paused.
She continued silent. &ldquo;Listen, then,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;tell me, then, who is Floria? Come, I insist on
it. Who is Floria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s body shuddered. Her lips moved but
made no sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Acting,&rdquo; De Medici whispered miserably to
himself. &ldquo;She wants to tell us something but
can&rsquo;t think clearly what.... No, not that. She
does just what she wishes. She confuses us, leaves
us up in the air more than before....&rdquo; He
caught a glimpse of Norton&rsquo;s intent and reddish
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Floria?&rdquo; repeated Dr. Lytton.</p>
<p>Florence stared at him with her pupil-centered
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Floria,&rdquo; she murmured. There was a pause.
Suddenly a scream rose from her lips. She tumbled
forward in her chair. De Medici sprang to
her side and saved her from falling to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wakened,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton explained, mopping
his heavy face. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s unconscious now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>He summoned the startled-looking matron and
ordered her to bring water and ammonia. Norton
assisted them in reviving her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please let me go back to the cell,&rdquo; she murmured
as her eyes opened. &ldquo;I feel so tired....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can gain nothing by talking to her,&rdquo; Dr.
Lytton agreed. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s on the verge of a collapse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matron helped her to rise. De Medici stood
beside her. He looked calmly at her eyes until
they turned from him. Her confusion and anguish
brought a deep pain to his own heart. But a
conviction masked his emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows,&rdquo; he murmured silently, &ldquo;she
knows and keeps silent. For a reason....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled almost happily at her as the matron
led her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this Floria?&rdquo; Lieutenant Norton was
demanding.</p>
<p>De Medici turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear lieutenant,&rdquo; he answered, his
voice strangely light, &ldquo;a marvelous person. A
suave Messalina.... You will find her some day.
With our assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed and his hand gracefully indicated the
doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found just who I want,&rdquo; Norton grunted.
His keen eyes gleamed with irritation. &ldquo;Miss
Ballau has been booked for the murder of her
stepfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes showed no emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton followed him out of the building.
The pathologist&rsquo;s face wore an air of violently
suppressed excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DAGGER OF MIST</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which a pathologist reasons himself into a railroad
trip&mdash;Francesca of the spiral eyes&mdash;The ancient science
of demonology&mdash;The visiting shadow&mdash;The dagger
that glistened against the moon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Night covered the streets. De Medici&rsquo;s expressionless
face nodded an attentive punctuation to
the talk of the pathologist as they left the police
station behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two and two,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton was saying exuberantly.
&ldquo;The thing evolves into an ABC of logic.
Poor child, poor child. You guessed it, too, eh,
Julien? Well, it was easy. Anybody but a policeman
would have seen it. But what acting! What
consummate acting! The voice, the centered eyes,
the collapse! A wonderful woman, Julien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she do it?&rdquo; De Medici asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Hm&mdash;to beat us at our own game,&rdquo; Dr.
Lytton laughed. &ldquo;To confuse us, bewilder us,
give us no trail at all where there had been the
beginning of a trail. Her hesitation over the name
Floria. Her inward struggle. Ha, what a complicated
fool she must take me for! But, thank
God, it happened. For the thing now suddenly
comes into the domain of logic. Yes, we&rsquo;ve done
everything but think. Simplicity is always the
soul of mystery. For instance, it was obvious to
me five minutes after Miss Ballau entered the
room that she was as normal and straightforward
a nature as any I have ever seen. There is not a
hint of the neurotic about her. Healthy, keen,
vivacious and an actress. Good Lord, what an
actress! The mock trance she went into was
superb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re convinced it was pretense?&rdquo; De Medici
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton answered. &ldquo;And
now we&rsquo;ll begin with the first letters of the alphabet.
Simplicity, dear Julien. Elementals that
we&rsquo;ve overlooked. First and finally, Florence
Ballau and Floria are not one and the same. The
handwriting ... bosh! The similarity is too
strained. The Floria notes were not written by
Florence Ballau. Yes, I stake my life on it, Floria
and Florence are two different persons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may sneer,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton cried, &ldquo;but wait.
We&rsquo;ll drop in at your rooms for a while. I&rsquo;ve
almost made up my mind to something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked in silence to De Medici&rsquo;s home.
Once more the two men seated themselves in the
room of the wine-colored velvets. De Medici had
inserted fresh candles in the holders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can discuss our little lesson,&rdquo; Dr.
Lytton smiled. &ldquo;You may interrupt anywhere
and any time you wish, Julien. First we have this
fact. Let&rsquo;s look at it. The arrest of Miss Ballau
in New York City yesterday morning established
the probability that Miss Ballau was not in Rollo,
Maine, yesterday morning. This makes it evident
that Florence Ballau didn&rsquo;t mail you the theatrical
little note you received a few hours ago from
Rollo, Maine. There&rsquo;s the stupid theory she might
have left it for someone else to mail after she&rsquo;d
come on to New York. Bosh! Involving a confederate,
which is one thing against it. But ... let
us remain simple and look at things easily. Florence
Ballau goes to Rollo, Maine. And after
twenty-four hours she returns to New York. And
after another twenty-four hours she returns to her
apartment and is arrested trying to destroy a
letter. A letter signed &lsquo;Floria&rsquo; and written by
the same hand that sent you your warning, Julien.
Do you follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It becomes obvious at once,&rdquo; continued Dr.
Lytton, &ldquo;that Floria is not a myth. Miss Ballau
risks detection to destroy notes this Floria has
written. Why does she do this? Ah, how easily
the answer comes. To protect this Floria. Yes,
it&rsquo;s been obvious from the first that Miss Ballau
knows a great deal either about the murder itself
or the incidents surrounding it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;To be brief, Julien, the girl knows who killed
her stepfather and, knowing it, she is going to all
lengths to hide the facts from the police. She will
even allow herself to be suspected of the crime and
the motives, which must nauseate her, in order to
have the murder fastened on her ... for the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; whispered De Medici softly. His hands
moved restlessly in his lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do we discover?&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor.
&ldquo;Merely a very simple thing. Miss Ballau
is sacrificing her liberty and reputation to protect
someone. And, mind you, this someone murdered
a man of whom she was very fond and to whom
she owed her success in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have ... a conclusion?&rdquo; De Medici
asked softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a conclusion,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton laughed. &ldquo;An
inevitability. Whom does she protect? Her
mother. The thing answers itself. Her mother,
of course. Miss Ballau is trying to save her
mother from being arrested for the murder of
Victor Ballau. And Miss Ballau&rsquo;s mother is the
Floria who baffles us. And I think if we caught a
train tonight we would find this Floria hidden
away somewhere in Rollo, Maine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; De Medici asked gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton fixed his excited eyes on his friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather stay near Florence,&rdquo; he
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Dr. Lytton stood up. &ldquo;Of course
the unexpected may upset us. One must always
keep one&rsquo;s mind open to the unexpected and study
it and resolve it automatically into the expected.
But at this moment I am convinced that Rollo,
Maine, is the end of our search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici appeared to galvanize into sudden
activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent, Hugo,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone.
There must be a train leaving before morning. It&rsquo;s
only eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He busied himself raising the railroad information
clerk on the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She leaves at eleven thirty,&rdquo; De Medici cried,
hanging up. &ldquo;Just enough time for you to take
it. Gets in to Rollo or somewhere near Rollo
at daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; Dr. Lytton looked at him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
it. And you&rsquo;ll probably hear by telegraph from
me before noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm, now,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton smiled.</p>
<p>De Medici was bustling him out of the room.
&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the doctor. For a moment he
hesitated, his eyes questioningly on the elongated
face of his host. Then with a shrug of his shoulders
the pathologist walked away in the direction
of the Grand Central station.</p>
<p>De Medici returned to his room&mdash;the room of
shadows and pointed candle flames where a few
hours before the intolerable vision had sent him
sprawling in horror at the curtain edge. Sighing,
he seated himself in the chair. Thank God, the
prying, restless eyes of his friend were gone. He
was alone. He could breathe, think, allow telltale
expressions to play over his face. All without
fear ... of what? De Medici shook his head.
His finger nails scratched at the side of his chair.
In response to this curious summons, the curtains
over the door stirred. A new shadow swayed
across the floor.</p>
<p>The lithe, black body of a cat approached the
scratching with stiff-legged caution. De Medici
watched the animal pause in the center of the
room, its back languidly arched under the yellow
candle rays. Its eyes burned in the half dark&mdash;two
tiny crosses green and phosphorescent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured De Medici, staring at his pet,
&ldquo;I must be wary.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;Fool! And what
do you think, Francesca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His hand stretched toward the waiting cat. It
approached and stood nearer his feet. Its burning
eyes seemed fastened on his. He sat silent,
watching the animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it begins again,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Her
back arches. Her hair bristles. Fright, wavering
terrors, move through her subtle veins. Look at
her. She sees something. What? God ... me.
Her eyes become a burning mirror for the
unknown....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused as the cat, obeying mysterious impulses,
grew tense, its back bristling with inexplicable
fears, its little, pointed teeth gleaming behind
drawn lips. Standing thus for a moment, it
recoiled suddenly from the figure of De Medici
and spat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Francesca,&rdquo; he murmured aloud, &ldquo;my
little mirror in which unseen ones spit back at
me. He said there was nothing ... nothing.
Minor hallucinations. Yes, a reassuring diagnosis.
Yet, who knows me? When I know nothing
myself, who can see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated again and then smiled tiredly at
the retreating animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, Francesca. No, it was another. I&rsquo;ve
committed no murder. The ghosts that wander
inside ... did they escape that night? No, I
remember nothing ... nothing like that. It is all
dream ... dark dream that embroiders my soul
with grewsome and ghostly patterns. Guilty!
Yes, I felt guilty. The detective&rsquo;s eyes. And then
Hugo.... The dark dream cringes under memories.
But there was no duality. No, it was not I.
Yet to others and to myself I act the part of a
murderer. I grow furtive. My words became cautious.
As if ... yes, as if I were feeling my way
through guilty memories. The logic of illusion,
nothing else. No demon haunts me. No masked
stranger rises evilly and exultantly in my body.
No, Francesca, they sleep too deep. They stir too
feebly. They throw only shadows ... shadows
that mock and frighten my eyes. Hm, shadows
whose dim fingers wrestle with my throat. But
these shadows are not I.... He was right ...
ideas with which I hypnotize myself. An obsession
that the past lurks unburied in me.... A
curious curse of imagination that sent my father
bellowing to his grave. But I have a brain! Do
you hear, Francesca? I have a brain. It flashes
out like a rapier and decapitates these demons at
which you, in your enigmatic ignorance, spit, little
cat. Do you see something moving behind the eyes
of your master? Illusion, Francesca, it exists
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish little cat, last of the terrified scientists
for whom chimera was reality. You cling to this
science of demonology. Your dark and theatrical
little soul, Francesca, delights in the quackery of
terror. What an immemorial fraud you are!
Come closer ... let me look into your Basque
eyes. See, nothing. My reason disarms you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The animal turned and walked slowly from him.
At the door, its head twisted back and its eyes
glittered for a moment like green and enigmatic
questions. Then, with a leap that startled the
shadows into motion, it vanished through the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If not I,&rdquo; mused De Medici, holding his gaze
to the candle flames, &ldquo;then, as he says, the mystery
grows simple. Neither I nor Florence. But someone
whom she protects. Again a finger points at
me. But would she protect me? No, not as she
does. Her mother. Yes, he was right. But what
sort of a woman must this be for whom she sacrifices
so much? Something odd about the Ballaus.
He was a strange man. Secrets lived in him. His
mask was more charming than mine, more simple.
Because the secret was not his own, not a part of
the fiber of his ego. But a knowledge of something.
I remember. It grimaced wearily behind
the debonair smile. It spoke at times out of his
eyes. He was tired, sad, and ridden by a fear of
something. The bon vivant, the connoisseur, was
a tenacious masquerade. There was suffering in
him. I remember. Yes, his austere silences. His
fingers escaping his will, trembling ... and his
smile that grew gentle and dull. And his virtue.
His phenomenal virtue. No women in his life.
Hugo wondered about that. I, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s thought grew dreamy and impersonal.
His keen and deciphering brain played
with the mystery of Ballau and his death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;He had a wife,&rdquo; his thought resumed. &ldquo;Yes,
and she killed him. Why? Revenge ... an obsession
for revenge. The Floria letter was mad....
And the note Florence tried to burn ...
mad, too. That time I found Florence looking as
if she had seen the devil.... That had something
to do with it. With her mother. Hm, bad news.
Intimidating news. And Ballau called her up that
night at the theater to tell her again this kind
of bad news. What? Let me see. &lsquo;Yes ... yes
... Oh, God!&rsquo; Her words on the phone. Then it
was information that didn&rsquo;t surprise her. Or she
would have asked a question, she would have said,
&lsquo;when,&rsquo; &lsquo;how,&rsquo; &lsquo;what,&rsquo; &lsquo;why.&rsquo; Any question. So it
was something she expected and dreaded. She
wept the morning I left her after the cab ride.
A secret saddened her, too. A thing she shared
with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see now. He called her up to tell her the
woman had appeared; to hurry home. It was the
evening of our party. Disgrace.... And she
answered, &lsquo;Yes ... yes....&rsquo; She would come
immediately. Therefore it was a terrible thing for
her mother to appear. Why was it terrible?
Obvious. Something wrong with her mother.
Mania ... the dagger signature was mania, too.
So she flew home. But too late. The camouflage....
Florence, of course. Hiding a trail. The costume
on the fire escape.... A foolish move. Her
mother&rsquo;s, however. But why a costume? Hm,
thirty minutes, perhaps forty.... Long enough
to get the woman away. And when she had done
this she rushed out and screamed.... The dagger
on the letter&mdash;yes, a maniacal creature who
fancied herself persecuted, wronged by poor Ballau,
her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>He felt tired. The room had grown chill. Rising,
he blew out three of the candles and walked
with the fourth to his bedroom. Here he turned on
lights. He stood before the massive, curtained
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sleep,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;And tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go
see her. I&rsquo;ll talk to her of her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a late April night. De Medici walked to
an opened window. The panorama of city night
spread below him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steel beast with too many eyes,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was better once.... Hm, in the days of
my charming forebears. Cloaks, and rapiers ...
sinister-lipped smiles, wine-drenched feasts ...
brocades and marbles ... incense and velvets ...
witches, poisons, intrigues and a laugh of
youth over the world. Ah, the Renaissance ...
it lives in me still. A Bacchanal and a hymn of
lust, pride, power ... their shadows whimper
inside me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Undressed, he drew the curtains of his bed half
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;They shut me out,&rdquo; he murmured drowsily,
staring at the dark hangings. &ldquo;And I can dream
more easily....&rdquo;</p>
<p>... He had been asleep. Now his eyes opened.
Terror stiffened his muscles. There was a noise.
A foot was gliding over the rugs. Slowly, softly....
His thought dwindled.... &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awake ...
awake....&rdquo; He lay trembling. Someone was
moving toward his bed ... a figure outside the
curtains that hid him. Murmurings, creaks, far-away
noises came to his frantic ears. But above
them the gentle pat of a foot growing louder.</p>
<p>His throat suddenly dried and the skin on his
body moved. A hand was drawing aside the curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francesca mia,&rdquo; whispered itself feebly
through his brain. But the hand was real. Either
that, or he was mad. No shadows, but a figure....
Or was he mad? An apparition. But this
time it did not pantomime out of the darkness. It
drew closer, its head billowing out the hangings.
A woman!... He lay stiff and silent. A woman
with hair hanging. Her eyes gleamed out of the
dark....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he cried. But his motion had come too
late. The dark figure&rsquo;s hand lunged at him. He
felt the steel of a knife burn in his flesh. Blood
gushed across his eyes. A laugh, high-pitched and
exultant, rang in his ears. He fell back and lay
motionless....</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">ELUSIVE CLIMAXES</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which Julien De Medici finds himself grewsomely
decorated&mdash;In which he passes triumphantly on his
own innocence&mdash;The exonerating wound&mdash;Candlestick
and cross again and the laugh of a new Francesca&mdash;A
new doubt&mdash;A telegram both absurd and bewildering&mdash;Cinematographic
clews.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dawn entered the room. The spring sun lay
brightly across the floor. From the street below
drifted in the noise of early traffic. And De
Medici opened his eyes. For a moment he stared
weakly at the canopy of his bed. Then a smile
turned his lips.</p>
<p>It was not a dream. His arm that he had thrust
across his face to protect him from the knife that
flashed in the moonlight lay limp and throbbing.
The pillow was covered with blood. Not a dream ...
no shadows launched from the evil depths of
De Medici. His smile deepened. He lay staring
at the top of his bed, musing happily....</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman with a dagger tried to kill me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes, lowering to his wounded arm, startled
before a thing that lay on his chest. A black
crucifix.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Then there should be a
candle ... a lighted candle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His head turned to the small table beside the
bed. It was standing there. The candlestick he
had brought in with him. And from its wick
flickered a sun-obscured little flame. He stared
intently. A paper-thin, whitened little flame....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ballau murder,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;candlestick
and crucifix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeling of panic swept him. The smile vanished.
He reached and snuffed out the wick with
his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ballau murder,&rdquo; he repeated to himself,
&ldquo;but a bit less thorough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smile returned again to his white face. He
raised his arm despite the pain in it.... A flesh
wound. Terror as much as pain or physical shock
had deprived him of his senses during the attack.
Now he pushed himself cautiously to a sitting
position and, with a strip of linen torn from the
sheet, bound his arm. Behind the smile which
lighted his worn-looking face he was thinking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what a relief! I breathe again. This
wound exonerates me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>The secret dread he had carried locked in his
brain since the finding of Ballau&rsquo;s body vanished
in a laugh. He sat, his head buzzing, his eyes
gleaming with happiness. He was free. The thing
he had carried in him, that had gnawed sickeningly
at the back of his thought, was removed. He
had not killed Ballau. No murderer lurked within
him. He laughed again at the na&iuml;vet&eacute; of his logic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For if it was I who murdered poor Ballau, it
was not I who came into this room last night and
tried to murder Julien De Medici. And since those
two figures are one and the same, selah! I am
innocent. What a sick, mad suspicion it was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shuddered at the memory of the secret that
had lived like a specter in his soul since the night
of the tragedy. An illusionary secret! For here
he lay the victim of an attack identical to the one
that had ended Ballau. The candlestick, the crucifix,
the dagger thrust.</p>
<p>Harding, the bland-faced valet, appeared in
answer to his ring. He stood regarding his master
in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your arm, sir....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mouth remained open and speechless as he
noted the disheveled hair and pallor of De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my arm,&rdquo; De Medici smiled. &ldquo;Fix it up.
A cut. Get some hot water and bathe it....
And, by the way, Harding, did you hear anybody
come in last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, somebody got into the room last night
and tried to knife me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard nobody,&rdquo; Harding answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>The valet busied himself excitedly dressing the
wound in his arm. De Medici sat smiling dreamily,
uttering occasional instructions and issuing orders
for breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get up and out at once,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t sir, with your arm in this condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense. A little food and I&rsquo;ll be whole
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was impatient to reach Norton. The doddering
imbecile! With his insane theories....
Holding her locked up, accusing her of motives
and a crime despite her transparent innocence!
Now that the perfect certainty of her innocence as
well as his own had taken root in his thought, the
knowledge of her arrest inflamed him. A simple
fact pounded almost gayly through his musings....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence is in jail. And during her incarceration,
Floria tried to murder me. The same Floria
who killed Ballau. A lunatic with a mysterious
murder ritual who signs her deed with a crucifix
and candle. With Florence in jail and Julien De
Medici in bed, there follow two delightful and
inevitable conclusions. Floria is neither Florence
nor De Medici. She is as innocent as I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Yes, Floria and Florence Ballau were two separate
and distinct people. The theory Dr. Lytton
had adopted stood proved. De Medici ate his
breakfast with a rising appetite. He smiled
almost childishly as he thought of his friend the
pathologist stumbling excitedly around the wastes
of Maine in quest of this Floria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his own fault,&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;He suggested
going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dressed, with his arm bandaged, De Medici
returned to his bedroom. It was nine o&rsquo;clock.
He would wait an hour, recuperating his strength,
and then storm the Bastille and confound Norton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be easy now,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Her desire to
save her mother will be futile. And what harm
would it do if her mother were sent to an asylum?
None. Yet she stands ready to sacrifice herself
for this crazed woman. Hm, altruism ... the
logic of situation dictates her sacrifice now. People
become the victims of habits&mdash;even self-destructive
habits. And this thing that animates
Florence is one of these....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off his musings and turned them on
Norton. A buoyancy played under his thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clever man,&rdquo; he smiled to himself, &ldquo;but
blinded by preconceptions and prejudices. He&rsquo;ll
hem and haw, stammer and grow desperate, as I
reason his quarry out of his hands....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The valet entered. De Medici looked up from
his food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telegram for you, sir,&rdquo; said Harding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sign for it,&rdquo; De Medici nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>A few minutes later the valet returned with a
yellow envelope. De Medici opened it. His lips
parted in astonishment and his eyes stared confusedly
as he read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Julien De Medici,</p>
<p>Have found Floria. Am bringing her back on train.
Arrives eleven tonight. She has confessed in full and
I have cleared up entire mystery. Our first theory correct.
Meet me at station. Imperative.</p>
<p><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Hugo Lytton</span>,</span>
<span class="jr">Rollo, Maine.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>De Medici studied the astounding document
while his watch ticked away a full ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hugo has gone mad,&rdquo; he finally murmured to
himself. There was no other explanation. Floria
captured in Rollo, Maine! A full confession!
When only a few hours ago she had been in his
bedroom, had struck at him with her dagger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn that imbecile,&rdquo; De Medici muttered.
He was thinking of his friend, his bald-headed,
glittering-eyed, smug-spoken friend who had gone
to Rollo and left his reason in New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only that explanation,&rdquo; his thought
repeated, &ldquo;a sudden mental collapse. Scientists
have a way of collapsing. He has undoubtedly
gone out of his wits.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>He sat staring at his unfinished breakfast. The
thing to do was to go to Norton, present his evidence
in full, appeal to the detective to co&ouml;perate
and put an end to the elusive turnings of the mystery.
With Lytton out of the hunt, with Lytton
bombinating crazily about Florias in Rollo, Maine,
the detective was a last ally.</p>
<p>De Medici left his rooms and walked slowly
toward the police station. He felt weak and uncertain
once more. A thought harassed him ...
what if Lytton wasn&rsquo;t mad? Yes, if the man were
sane he was a formidable person to fool. But
there could be no question about it. A fog settled
in De Medici&rsquo;s head, a fog which again obscured
the certainties that had elated him a few hours
ago.</p>
<p>Cautiously he rehearsed his memories of the
attack. A woman in a trailing gown had entered
his bedroom around four o&rsquo;clock in the morning
and tried to murder him. She had left him for
dead, first placing a crucifix on his chest and a
lighted candle at his head. Yes, there was utterly
no way in which one could avoid the conclusion
... the inevitable conclusion that this woman
was the Floria who had murdered Victor Ballau.
Unless ... he shuddered ... unless it was
not Floria who had killed Ballau but someone
else.... Unless Floria was one who knew the
slayer of Ballau and for this reason.... Again
he shuddered. The theory gave him a new headache....
Florence was secreting the mysterious
Floria, not to save her, but to prevent her from
falling into the hands of the police and telling
what she knew.... Then it was Florence
again....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>De Medici entered Lieutenant Norton&rsquo;s office, his
face once more the expressionless mask which had
irritated and confused the detective at the beginning.
He waited several minutes before Norton
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; De Medici greeted him. The
lieutenant nodded and, his brows puckered, sat
down. Turning to his visitor his eyes widened
with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d seen the
devil....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; De Medici smiled faintly. His new
fears had emptied him of the scene he had planned
with the man&mdash;a casual and triumphant scene with
Norton cringing and miserable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a
rather bad night,&rdquo; he added vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the lieutenant shrugged, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been no
worse a night than I&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton sighed and, leaning forward, placed his
hand on De Medici&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I feel I owe you
an apology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; De Medici agreed, &ldquo;I was coming to
that. How is Miss Ballau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lieutenant smiled tiredly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t rub it in,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Miss
Ballau is quite well, I fancy. Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I just got here,&rdquo; De Medici said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean did you see her last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici stared at the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I saw her last night ... here. You
were here....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean after our little party here,&rdquo; Norton
went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I left?&rdquo; De Medici began and paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norton&rsquo;s wearied eyes confused him. After he
had left? Then....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Ballau?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I said before,&rdquo; Norton answered, &ldquo;I
owe you an apology. We let her go almost immediately
after you and the doctor left. The case
against her has collapsed. That is, so far as her
actual guilt is concerned. That&rsquo;s why I called you
over last night. I thought you might fill in the
missing links.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s face remained without expression
but his thoughts were circling wildly once more.
Norton was still talking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mistake to arrest her at all. I felt
from the beginning that we were acting too hastily.
But the burned note sort of decided things for
me ... for a little while. But&mdash;there were too
many unexplained things ... too many ends. So
we let her go. It&rsquo;s the only way. She knows
something and it&rsquo;s impossible to get it out of her
here. We&rsquo;ve got a better chance waiting for her to
lead us to the man or woman who murdered Ballau.
She&rsquo;s shielding someone. I could see it last
night....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo; De Medici interrupted
tensely.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Norton shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think my men will locate her before the day
is over,&rdquo; he answered with bitterness. &ldquo;But she
eluded us after we let her go. That idiot Michaelson....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lost track of her?&rdquo; De Medici murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Norton swore, &ldquo;she went out of here and
... that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said De Medici.</p>
<p>He stood up and forgetting to say good-by to the
man, walked slowly out of the office. Norton
stared after him. In the street De Medici paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll send somebody to follow me,&rdquo; he mused.
&ldquo;He thinks I know where she is ... and know
more than I&rsquo;ve told.... He let her go.... Then
he must suspect someone else. Me, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled wryly. His thought took another
turn. He had withheld the thing from his mind.
It came now swiftly and in detail....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was Florence,&rdquo; he muttered. A chill came
over him. He walked slowly, speculations and
conjectures dancing in his brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d only held her till this morning,&rdquo; he
mused desperately, &ldquo;her innocence would have
been established. But now ... good God! a few
hours after her release from the cell I am attacked
by Floria ... as Ballau was attacked. Yes, it
was she. I remember something. What? What?
Hm, it&rsquo;s too inhuman. Florence creeping into my
room to murder me! Two weeks ago she kissed
me. It&rsquo;s insane ... a bewildering circle ...
Ballau&rsquo;s body with a dagger in its heart, a dance
of lunatic clews and macabre evasions which seem
to be ending as insanely as they began. Now we
come to another arc in this circle. She tried to
murder me last night. Why?... Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the telegram from his pocket. Lytton
was a man with a powerful mind, a man not to be
fooled. What if he had captured the real Floria?
She was someone whom Florence was trying to
shield.... Again the chill dropped into De
Medici&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;Her mother,&rdquo; he went on to himself, &ldquo;Lytton&rsquo;s
captured her mother. And Florence expected
something of the sort. Another effort to
throw suspicion from the woman.... Yes, she
came into my room last night. Why? Ah, it
grows simple. To repeat the Ballau crime and
distract suspicion from the creature in Rollo.
There&rsquo;s a terrible logic to the thing. Florence
under a mania worse than her mother&rsquo;s ... the
mania of sacrifice.... A habit that undermines.
The martyr obsession. She feared Dr. Lytton
and, released from jail, she hurried to commit a
crime so similar in its details to the one committed
by the real Floria that the conclusion would be
inevitable; Floria was in New York and not in
Maine....&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici walked on, his head lowered, his
eyes gleaming with despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the wrong track,&rdquo; he announced
suddenly to himself; &ldquo;farcical sleuths trailing
chimeras. We&rsquo;ve bungled everything. There&rsquo;s
something else ... someone else. It&rsquo;s I she
suspects. Her silence, her strangeness, everything....
A ruse to protect me. The burned letter
... all part of her plan. There is no Floria....
She&rsquo;s saving me from a crime she thinks I
committed....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his thought stopped and a sigh escaped
him. He had been trying to build himself against
the despair that lacerated his heart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;no. It was she last night
in my room. A false attack. She didn&rsquo;t mean
murder. It was made merely as a gesture to establish
her mother&rsquo;s innocence. Hm, but I know
better than that. The dagger plunged for my
heart.... Too clear a memory to evade. My
arm saved me.... A crazed woman. And what
else? Oh, yes, the laugh. I remember.... She
laughed. After the dagger had struck, she
laughed.... And it was her voice. I remember
now. Florence&rsquo;s voice, wild and crazed, laughing
over me ... after the dagger had struck....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knowledge which overcame him sickened
his thought. His face had become drawn. Fears
ached in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worthy of other days,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Yes,
a plot out of De Medici annals. But I must find
her. Unless I find her I&rsquo;ll go mad myself....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up and saw ahead of him the Hudson
Apartments. He had, without thinking of destination,
walked toward the Ballau home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be there,&rdquo; he murmured with sudden
conviction. And his eyes growing excited, he
walked toward the familiar entrance.</p>

which an old woman makes an exciting purchase&mdash;In
which Julien De Medici pursues an aged
Alice in Wonderland&mdash;The beginning of a story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Donovan, the doorman, greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s quite a
crowd, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded. He recalled there was to
be an auction of the Ballau treasures. Money was
needed to pay the dead man&rsquo;s debts and provide
his daughter with expenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Started yet?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Donovan&rsquo;s eyes took in the vestibule. He came
a step closer and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Mr. De Medici, there&rsquo;s been a lot of
clews around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici assumed an air of polite conspiratorial
interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Donovan, &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t tell all
I knew to none of them, seeing it wasn&rsquo;t anything
that would help. But I&rsquo;ll tell you, sir. Things
weren&rsquo;t all right in the Ballau apartment for some
time. Many the time I&rsquo;ve passed their door and
heard screaming. A woman screaming and Mr.
Ballau arguing with her....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doorman straightened and resumed his
doorman manner. A group of visitors to the auction
had entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk more about it later,&rdquo; De Medici
murmured and stepped toward the elevator.</p>
<p>Voices came from behind the closed door of the
Ballau apartment. De Medici pressed the bell and
waited. The door opened slowly. A sound of
chattering and laughter struck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he bowed to the woman who had
admitted him. Jane. He looked curiously at her.
For a moment he had failed to recognize her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In there, sir,&rdquo; she said, indicating the crowded
library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they started yet, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how have you been? I haven&rsquo;t seen you
since the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head. Tears lighted her haggard
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re selling all his things,&rdquo; she whispered;
&ldquo;all his nice things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Miss Ballau been here yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ballau!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;She ... she
was arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>The old woman&rsquo;s shoulders fell and tears rolled
over her thin cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Ballau was released last night,&rdquo; De
Medici said softly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s quite all right
now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Jane nodded.</p>
<p>He walked toward the crowded room. He would
talk to her later. Florence had induced her to
perjure herself. He recalled Donovan ... a
woman screaming and Ballau arguing with her.
Yes, maybe Jane could help out....</p>
<p>In the library he took his place unobtrusively on
the edge of the scene. His preoccupation filmed
the excitement for him.... The visitor with the
dagger. And, worse, her laugh as he lay presumably
dying, stabbed to death.... Mania&mdash;no
question of that. And Hugo had didactically pronounced
her normal. He was thinking of Florence.
His mind played deliberately with his emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence, mad,&rdquo; he stood thinking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
interesting to think of someone I know and love
being mad. It produces fear&mdash;delightful fear.
Hm, love is the ornamental curtain behind which
all the pathologies disport themselves clownishly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He studied the scene. A throng of varied hats,
chattering faces. The light was dim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Half drawn curtains,&rdquo; De Medici mused.
&ldquo;Meyerson stages it well. The drama of mystery
lends a tantalizing value to the objects under his
hammer. The talk is low-pitched. Eyes glance
furtively around. Yes, this is the sort of thing
that appeals to the normal imagination. Melodrama&mdash;the
melodrama of externals. They look
and see a conventional room, conventional walls,
drapes and ceiling. Commonplace things in an
uncommonplace light ... the familiar decks
in a lurid symbolism. And they thrill at the
thought that murder and mystery lurk behind the
uninteresting masks of convention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear,&rdquo; he continued to himself, &ldquo;is the most
seductive of the emotions. It prostrates itself
deliciously before all unknown things. In its grip
one rises to mysticism. And these people shiver
and revel in the thought that they are part of
something more enigmatic than the transparent
routine of commerce and society ... part of a
melodrama which tiptoes gaudily in the corners of
this dimly lighted room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the large table
at the end of the room, behind which Meyerson
and two assistants had taken their places. His
thoughts assumed a practical air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would come here,&rdquo; he began in a new
vein. &ldquo;Curiosity would bring them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was thinking of the strange life Ballau had
led, of the curious folk whom he had known in his
wanderings as actor, dilettante and collector.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;There should be something to seize on here,&rdquo;
he stood musing. &ldquo;Not that I have any faith in
so-called criminal psychology ... the criminal
returning to the scene of his crime. Poppycock!
And yet there is something in the notion. A desire
to boast. A desire to test one&rsquo;s immunity to
detection by mingling with people under the noses
of the very police looking for one. Also a feeling
of insecurity. Yes, a criminal would feel the suspense
of insecurity, and in order to make certain
that he was as yet not suspected he might seek out
the presence of his pursuers. As for the scene of
the crime idea itself, a crime which created a
sense of satisfaction in its perpetrator might lure
him to enjoy its memory more vividly by a return
to the scene. If he still felt the original exultation
which the murder aroused in him, the sense of
freedom and sudden quiet which such an act would
undoubtedly bring to his inner self, he would
return just as a drug addict is unable to keep away
from the cabinet containing his favorite drug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued De Medici, inwardly amused
by his seeming knowledge of the subject, &ldquo;if the
criminal was frightened, if his sense of relief was
secondary to his feeling of remorse, would he come
back then? Not if he were half normal. An
abnormal, psychopathic person would be lured by
the thing toward which he felt fear. The hypnosis
of terror. Hm, an unlikely theory. The bird and
the snake idea and as fallacious as that. Snakes
do not hypnotize birds, nor do corpses hypnotize
murderers. A man seeking to overcome his fear
would return just as an old maid looks under the
bed to show herself that there is nothing there to
be worried about....</p>
<p>&ldquo;So where are we? No place. He or she may
be here at the auction. And, again, he or she may
not. That&rsquo;s the trouble with psychology. At its
best, psychology is an elastic process one uses in
vindicating one&rsquo;s preconceived ideas.... I came
here with a feeling that something would most
likely occur. And here I am trying to bolster up
this intuition with involved and spurious logic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up, aware of a silence. Meyerson had
taken his place behind the long table and was
rapping for order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; the man began, &ldquo;we
are about to dispose of the collections which were
lately the property of Victor Ballau. These
things comprise art treasures, literary treasures,
ornaments, hangings, all of exceptional value and
unquestionable taste. I wish to announce that I
have taken charge of this auction, that my house
has put a value upon each of the objects which will
be offered to you. It is understood that if the
bidding falls under this value the firm of Meyerson
&amp; Company will purchase it at the price already
fixed. We will now begin. Mr. Jones will take
charge of the selling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Meyerson nodded toward a narrow-faced young
man standing near him. The young man, Mr.
Jones, stepped forward and, clearing his throat
portentously, launched into the rigmarole of the
auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; his voice rang out, an
excitement in its tone, &ldquo;the first object for your
consideration this afternoon is a set of Chinese
chess men carved two thousand years ago by the
skillful fingers of an Oriental craftsman in Hwang
Ho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Jones turned toward a second young man,
who lifted a large ebony box into view and
removed its cover. Selecting one of the chess
pieces from it, the orator continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each and every one of these is an exquisitely
carved little statue worthy the hand of a master.
The craftsmanship and genius that went into the
construction of these charming intellectual toys
are part of a lost art. There are only three sets
of this description in the world. What am I bid,
ladies and gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bidding began at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty dollars,&rdquo; said a voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Mr. Jones resumed his excited recommendation.
De Medici, half listening, heard the phrases,
&ldquo;marvelous taste,&rdquo; &ldquo;carved under a microscope,&rdquo;
&ldquo;purest ivory....&rdquo; He smiled as, after fifteen
minutes of jockeying, the set went to Meyerson,
who had valued it at $1,500. A pair of Ming vases
came next. Two Shakespeare folios followed. An
antique rosewood chair was offered.</p>
<p>De Medici listened and watched with increasing
interest. The sale of Ballau&rsquo;s treasures had
stirred no covetousness in him. Yet the scene
acquired an exciting significance in his thought.
As each of the objects passed under the hammer
De Medici found himself coming closer to the
memory of his dead friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;it would seem that
these things that are being sold were Victor Ballau.
At least the Ballau I knew. Curious, how
friendship may be like that&mdash;an admiration for the
things surrounding a man and for the varied
images of him which these things reflect. I&rsquo;m glad
Meyerson has been decent about it. Otherwise the
thing would have degenerated into a grab bag
bargain rush ... everybody snatching at the
remains of poor Ballau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The place was growing stuffy. De Medici experienced
a reaction. The adventure of the night,
and the subsequent enigmas which he had pursued,
began to take toll. He would wait a few more
minutes and leave. The auction, despite his intuitions,
was turning out a cut and dried business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>He turned to look at the crowd from a new
angle, and his eyes lighted on a remarkable figure.
An old woman with the face of a witch, her head
covered by a black bonnet, her chin resting on the
knob of a heavy cane that she clasped in her hands,
sat within a few feet of him. Her face was a blur
of wrinkles, the nose and chin coming almost
together over a toothless mouth. Her little black
eyes, however, appeared to be blazing with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; De Medici murmured to himself, &ldquo;a
creature of sinister ugliness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to study her. She was following each
of the objects offered the crowd with a fanatical
intensity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cupidity,&rdquo; he thought, losing track of the auctioneer&rsquo;s
chatter. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll buy nothing. But the
joy of possessing animates her. It&rsquo;s a way people
have of clinging to life&mdash;by developing hobbies,
by achieving grotesque and concentrated enthusiasms
for certain objects. Existence is less complicated
for a stamp collector than a social
philosopher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His vague musings were suddenly broken. The
witch-like creature had risen from her chair and
was brandishing her heavy cane in the air. She
stood cackling in a strident voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forty dollars, Mr. Auctioneer, forty dollars....&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici watched her push her way forward
violently, her large body dislodging an amused
and indignant line of men and women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty dollars,&rdquo; she cried furiously as she
moved to the auctioneer&rsquo;s table, her cane still
describing eccentric circles in the air.</p>
<p>De Medici turned to see what had aroused the
creature. The narrow-faced Mr. Jones had
paused deferentially in his harangue, holding an
object in his hand ... an ornamental bronze
candlestick. For a moment the scene remained a
meaningless bit of excitement involving the grotesque
old woman and the polite auctioneer. Then
a warmth animated De Medici. His eyes shone.
The thing had happened! The candlestick in the
man&rsquo;s hand was one of the pair. Yes, it or its
mate had stood beside the head of Ballau on the
night he was found murdered. And there had
been a lighted candle beside his own head a few
hours ago.</p>
<p>Candlesticks ... candlesticks! There lay the
mainspring of the mystery. Murder was a simple
thing. People killed each other. And there was
nothing to be deduced from actions as broad and
general as murder. It was by the odd detail that
a crime might be uncovered ... the thing that
was a signature to the deed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>Confused and elate, De Medici watched the auctioneer
address the old woman in a whisper. The
candlestick was wrapped up and handed to its new
owner. He heard Mr. Jones explaining: &ldquo;Yes,
there&rsquo;s another. A mate to this, but it&rsquo;s not on
sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she had asked for the other one, too. The
one which formed part of the mysterious evidence
in the hands of the police. His meditations ended
as the creature pushed past him. She had apparently
lost all further interest in the auction. She
had bought the mate to the candlestick that had
stood at Victor Ballau&rsquo;s head the night he was
murdered ... and was leaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what I was expecting,&rdquo; De Medici
murmured inwardly, &ldquo;something like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was following her carefully into the hall and
out of the apartment. She paid no attention to
him as they entered the elevator together. With
her package clutched under her arm, she walked
off limpingly down the street, a heavily dressed,
bent old woman leaning on a cane, her witch face
peering obliviously ahead of her. De Medici,
smiling, sauntered in her wake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must forget everything,&rdquo; he mused,
&ldquo;Florence, Rollo, Maine, midnight visitors and
everything, and pay attention. Here&rsquo;s a clew. It
may be a coincidence. A candlestick fanatic. But
the Ballau auction would be out of her way. Park
Avenue is a foreign settlement to her. She came
there for a purpose. She showed interest in nothing
until the candlestick was offered. Yes, she
came to buy one thing&mdash;the pair of candlesticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slow chase turned out of the main thoroughfares.
The old woman seemed in no hurry. She
zigzagged from one street into another. Despite
her age her bent body seemed tireless. For an
hour she continued moving, ignoring street cars
and vehicles. A labyrinth of decrepit little streets
confronted De Medici. Pawn-shops, dirty-looking
stores, restaurants and movie theaters.... &ldquo;As
I thought,&rdquo; De Medici mused, &ldquo;Park Avenue is a
foreign settlement to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused a short distance from the old woman.
She had come to a halt in front of a decrepit house.
The blousy street was alive with noisy, dirty-faced
children, fat women and foreign-looking men.</p>
<p>The old woman peered about her for a moment
and then moved toward the evil-looking shack.
De Medici watched her body disappear slowly
down a flight of basement steps and hurried forward.
As he arrived, she entered the lower part
of the house through an ugly-looking door. He
could hear her lame step thumping in the distance
from the foul-smelling hallway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>It was dark. De Medici hesitated as a door
opened. The woman had vanished behind it. He
walked carefully down the stretch of dark hall and,
locating the door, knocked. There was no answer.
Turning the knob cautiously, he opened the door
and entered. A startling scene greeted him. He
found himself in a disordered room dimly lighted
by a single window that rose to an alley. The
place was heaped with clothes and strange pieces
of furniture that crowded each other against the
wall. Over a half hidden table the old woman
stood bent, eagerly unwrapping her package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; De Medici remarked. &ldquo;Sorry to
disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman wheeled around. Her little
black eyes blazed at the intruder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out ... get out!&rdquo; she cried stridently,
raising the heavy cane menacingly. She advanced
toward him in a fury. De Medici retreated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just wanted to talk to you for a moment,&rdquo; he
added calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out! Get out of my home,&rdquo; screamed the
old woman.</p>
<p>His hand caught the cane as it descended toward
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; he smiled at her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here
for anything except to ask you a question. I saw
you at the Ballau auction and followed you here.
I was a friend of Mr. Ballau. I wanted to talk to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>The creature&rsquo;s attitude changed. She looked at
him in silence and lowered herself into one of the
many chairs that crowded the dimly lighted place.</p>
<p>De Medici nodded gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I followed you because you bought that candlestick,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;I wanted to ask you why
you bought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman nodded and repeated his words
with an elated cackle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, why I bought the candlestick!&rdquo; She
paused and beamed at him. &ldquo;Nobody else got
the candlestick....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An eccentric,&rdquo; De Medici murmured. Her
ugliness and sinisterness had given way in the
moment to a childishness. Aloud he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much interested in that candlestick
... and the other one, its mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the other one!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed.
&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have it. My, my! I couldn&rsquo;t get
it. I wanted them both, but they had only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her visitor, and then cocking her
head to a side, inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well ... so you were a friend of Victor
Ballau. Ha, sit down, young man. Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici obeyed, his mind busy with ways in
which he might surprise whatever secrets from
the old woman that lay behind the wrinkled witch&rsquo;s
mask of her face. She sat rubbing her hands
together nervously and regarding him with
brightened eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to buy the candlestick?&rdquo;
De Medici asked again, his voice mild. His eyes,
accustoming themselves to the poor light, were
taking in some of the features of the room. He
had the sense for a moment of having blundered
into a theatrical warehouse. Spangled gowns,
tawdrily upholstered chairs, sofas, dilapidated
theater trunks, ancient &ldquo;flats&rdquo; containing parts of
drawing-room walls, and various other knick-knacks
which he recognized as scenic fittings, littered
the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the way you went after that candlestick,&rdquo;
he was saying with a careful smile, &ldquo;I
thought maybe you knew something about it ...
and its mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, I wanted them both,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but
there was only one. But I&rsquo;ll get the other one
sometime. You wait and see. I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harmless,&rdquo; thought De Medici swiftly, &ldquo;and
not on her guard. It&rsquo;ll be best to talk directly.&rdquo;
He continued aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you want them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha,&rdquo; the old woman cackled in answer. &ldquo;I
wanted them, all right. I know something about
them. Ha, they belong to me. This one does,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you know about them?&rdquo; De Medici
persisted. His body was quivering with excitement.
Here lay a clear and open track. Here was
a creature who knew something about the candlestick
signature. But her next words irritated
him. Her childishness would be as hard to circumvent
as shrewdness might have been.</p>
<p>She leaned forward and spoke in a hysterical
whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were Victor Ballau&rsquo;s candlesticks,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; De Medici nodded impatiently.
&ldquo;But why did you want them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I want them? Ha! Look at this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gnarled hand proudly indicated the cluttered
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got most of it all here, young man. Nearly
all of it. Years and years it&rsquo;s took to get it all.
And when I read in the papers that Victor Ballau&rsquo;s
ownings were going to be auctioned off, I
knew I&rsquo;d find something I wanted because Victor
Ballau was always fond of the old Goldsmith and
I knew he&rsquo;d have some of the things. And, sure
enough, there was the candlestick. But there
ought to have been two of them and there was only
one. I recognized it at once ... although it&rsquo;s
more than twenty years since I&rsquo;ve seen it. But
it&rsquo;s genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see them last?&rdquo; De Medici
asked, his thought groping with the word &ldquo;Goldsmith.&rdquo;...
He was thinking, &ldquo;the Goldsmith
Theater ... oh, yes, the program in the handbag.
It was the Goldsmith Theater program....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She interrupted his gropings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;they couldn&rsquo;t fool my old
eyes. They belonged to the Bandoux Repertoire
Company of the old Goldsmith.&rdquo; She became
excited with memories. &ldquo;Yes, yes, those were the
days. You should have been there, young man,
you should have known those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Goldsmith Theater in London,&rdquo; murmured
De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The finest repertoire company that ever
lived!&rdquo; the old woman exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you happen to be interested in the old
Goldsmith?&rdquo; he interrupted with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me! Me! Ask anybody if they remember old
Fanny of the Goldsmith,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I worked
there for twenty-five years. I was dresser and
mistress of the wardrobe, I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; De Medici nodded, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s how
you knew Mr. Ballau.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;Knew him,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;did I know Victor
Ballau! He would tell you, if he was alive, how
much I knew him.&rdquo; She appeared to be challenging
mysterious contradiction. De Medici sighed
inwardly. The intuitions which had led him to the
auction congratulated themselves. He realized a
slight disappointment. Childishly, he had expected
immediate revelations&mdash;complete unravelings
of the thing that had clouded his thought.
Nevertheless he smiled and settled back. There
was something here. This was a woman to whom
part of Victor Ballau&rsquo;s life that even he had never
been allowed to penetrate was a matter of intimate
knowledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little deranged,&rdquo; he thought quickly as she
arose and puttered around, &ldquo;and the victim of a
monomania. Her senility has developed a miserly
love for trinkets and dresses of the stage with
which she was surrounded in her youth. She&rsquo;s
evidently devoted herself to accumulating these
souvenirs of her past. Hm, and something else.
Florence&rsquo;s mother. Ballau wasn&rsquo;t her father.
Norton established that. Then this creature
should know about the woman Ballau married&mdash;Florence&rsquo;s
mother....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His musings ended. In a flash the theory concerning
Florence&rsquo;s mother returned in full to his
thought ... the woman for whom Florence had
been intent upon sacrificing herself and whose
guilt she had tried to assume.... He leaned forward
and spoke soothingly to the ancient wardrobe
mistress:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name is De Medici,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the
reason I was interested in the candlestick you
bought is that one of the pair was found at Mr.
Ballau&rsquo;s head when he was murdered. I am
engaged to marry Florence Ballau and I&rsquo;ve been
working with the police trying to find out who it
was killed her father. Now, if you can tell me
anything that might throw a light on this thing,
it would be doing a great service to the memory of
Mr. Ballau ... and the Bandoux Repertoire
Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know about that,&rdquo; the old woman answered
in a whisper. She seated herself again. &ldquo;I read
about it in the papers. I ain&rsquo;t seen Victor Ballau
since he left London. And he ain&rsquo;t wanted me to
see him, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; De Medici nodded. His manner
had become calm and ingratiating. &ldquo;After all
you knew about him, I shouldn&rsquo;t think he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it wasn&rsquo;t his fault,&rdquo; the woman went
on. &ldquo;But let bygones be bygones. I hold nothing
against him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know the woman he married in London?&rdquo;
De Medici interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh, yes. I knew her well enough. Madam
Bandoux.&rdquo; She nodded vigorously. The old
eyes gleamed and the bony hands trembled with
excitement. But words seemed slow and De Medici
prompted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was Florence Ballau&rsquo;s mother, wasn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute!&rdquo; the creature cried. &ldquo;She
was Florence Bandoux, whose first husband used
to own the company at the Goldsmith. And she
was Miss Florence&rsquo;s mother. Yes, I know all
about that. You&rsquo;ve come to the right place, young
man, to find out all about that. Nobody knows as
much as me what happened at the old Goldsmith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through De Medici&rsquo;s mind flitted the memory of
the leather purse he had picked up in the Ballau
library on the night of the murder, with the
initials F. B. in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what became of Florence Bandoux?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>The old woman was staring at him. Her body
had grown rigid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered finally, &ldquo;I know. And
I ain&rsquo;t ever whispered a word of it to anybody. I
know what became of Madam Bandoux. Victor
Ballau killed her. Don&rsquo;t you tell anybody I told
you, but that&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s what happened. He
killed her, I tell you. He was a murderer, was
Victor Ballau. He fooled them all but he didn&rsquo;t
fool me. But he&rsquo;s dead now and I never said a
word of it when he was alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici placed his hand soothingly on her
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Fanny, tell me about it. It all
happened long ago and there&rsquo;s nothing to be
afraid of, now Mr. Ballau&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, young man,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;We
were to have finished the season, but Ballau took
her away. He was stage manager then at the
Goldsmith and there was a lot of talk. Madam
Bandoux was a great actress but a bad woman.
She broke poor Victor&rsquo;s heart. And after that he
took her away and nobody ever heard of her
again. Everybody thought she came to America
with him. But I know better. She died in England,
and he killed her. She broke his heart, I
tell you. And that&rsquo;s why he killed her. When she
was young she ran away and married Bandoux,
the Frenchman. And a year later she came back
to London with the baby Florence. Bandoux came
back, too, but he refused to have anything more to
do with her. And, what&rsquo;s more, he said they
weren&rsquo;t married. All the time this went on poor
Victor Ballau was in love with her and she threw
him over to run off with the Frenchman. But when
she came back poor Victor took up with her again.
But she hated him. She hated him all the time,
and nothing he could do was any use. The girl
was Bandoux&rsquo;s daughter, not Victor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you know he killed her?&rdquo; De
Medici persisted softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know I&rsquo;m sitting here?&rdquo; the old
woman answered. &ldquo;Because I know. I&rsquo;ll tell you.
I used to hear them quarreling. It was awful.
And one night after the show I was passing
Madam Bandoux&rsquo;s dressing-room and I heard her
screaming. And I stopped to listen, and there was
poor Victor inside saying: &lsquo;Do you detest me like
that? Do you loathe me like that?&rsquo; And Madam
was screaming, &lsquo;I do ... I do.&rsquo; And then I
heard Victor Ballau say in a low voice, &lsquo;Then
I&rsquo;ll have to kill you.&rsquo; And that was a few days
before she disappeared. They went away together
after that. But nobody ever heard of Madam
again. He came to America alone a little while
after, taking the baby with him. But nobody ever
heard about poor Madam Bandoux except there
was a rumor he had married her, Victor Ballau
had. And I kept my mouth shut because I was
sorry for him and he was a fine man before it
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what else do you know?&rdquo; De Medici murmured.</p>
<p>The old woman laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shouldn&rsquo;t have killed her. He was such a
nice man. But that&rsquo;s the way life is. The nice
people do all the bad things. And he got his
reward, poor Victor did. Somebody killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I want to talk to you can I find you here,
Fanny?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here. All day,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>He spent a few minutes thanking the old woman
and finally closed the door of the littered basement
room behind him. In the street he walked swiftly,
intent on finding a cab. A few minutes later he
was riding through the traffic. His eyes half shut,
he was again tracing the circles of the mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>&ldquo;From what she said,&rdquo; he thought as the cab
bounced slowly forward, &ldquo;one thing becomes
certain. Florence Bandoux is still alive. It was
her purse I found in the library. Her initials.
And the woman Hugo is bringing back from Rollo
tonight is Florence Bandoux, alias Floria, the
lady of the dagger. So far, so good. But this
other thing, then. Hm, an offensive discrepancy.
The attack on me. That wasn&rsquo;t by Floria, then.
Yes, I was right before. A sickening idea. But
it was Florence trying to imitate her mother.
Willing to kill me and thinking she had ... and
laughing. But for whom did she laugh so insanely?
Because madness was in her. Her desire
to divert suspicion from her mother become a
mania. Grief and terror unbalancing her mind.
And in an hour of insanity this grewsome plan of
imitating Floria and thus exonerating the woman
she had hidden in Rollo, Maine. To be understood.
Yes, easy to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An emotion shattered the sentences. He loved
her. And she had tried to kill him. It didn&rsquo;t
matter. He still loved her, adored her. The sense
of her torment and madness seemed to bring him
prostrate before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must save her,&rdquo; he mumbled to himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go home and write her a letter. I&rsquo;ll get it to
her somehow. I&rsquo;ll tell her everything I know.
Everything ... yes, about Floria and about the
thing in my room....&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TWO FLORIAS</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In which Julien De Medici meets a train and grapples
with a skyrocket&mdash;The triumphant phantoms again&mdash;In
which Dr. Lytton relates an incredible story concerning
dawn in Rollo, Maine&mdash;&ldquo;Come at once&mdash;she
is dying.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The train was pulling in. Its headlight swinging
down the track filled De Medici with violent
emotion. In a few minutes Dr. Lytton would
alight, leading at his side the long sought and
mysterious Floria.</p>
<p>With a roar and hiss of steam, the train loomed
at his side and came to a stop. The bustle of
alighting passengers ensued. Sleepy-eyed travelers
entering New York at midnight, loaded down
with bags and packages, began to emerge from the
cars. De Medici&rsquo;s eyes raced from exit to exit.
Impatience had deprived him of thought. He
stood shivering in the smoke-filled shed. Figures
hurried by. Then someone called his name. Turning
excitedly, De Medici found himself face to face
with his friend Dr. Lytton. And at Dr. Lytton&rsquo;s
side stood Florence Ballau.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s thought remained in suspension.
He noticed that the doctor was holding her arm,
that she was pale and almost tottering, and that
her eyes were half closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cab,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton ordered tersely. &ldquo;Hurry!
She&rsquo;s in a bad state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still De Medici stood motionless. The shock
that the sight of Florence had given him had vanished
almost immediately. There was another
confusion now, a familiar and vaporous twisting in
his head, as if thoughts were endeavoring to turn
themselves inside out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry, Julien. A cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dazedly, De Medici turned and walked out of
the station toward the cab stand. He waited until
the two arrivals caught up. His eyes stared miserably
at the ground. Inside the machine he
forced a question from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find her, Hugo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton shook his head. A triumphant gleam
was in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in due time,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Wait till we
get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici was relieved for the silence. He sat
with his head sunk, inwardly conscious of the inanimate
Florence beside him. She had spoken no
word of greeting or explanation. His thought
traced itself sardonically over a single sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is Floria!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>A desire to laugh came to him. The shock which
her unexpected appearance beside Dr. Lytton had
given him had been short-lived. At once, on top
of his astonishment, had bloomed a new fear. At
the sight of her and the triumphant-eyed scientist
De Medici became aware in an instant that his
carefully pieced-together theory of the thing lay in
shreds. Unable to keep his thought calm and
invent something plausible to explain the insane
shiftings of the past few weeks, the terror from
which he had suffered during the early days of the
Ballau mystery reinstated itself.</p>
<p>He sat now with his carefully molded smile, the
smile that had aggravated the suspicions of
Norton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing comes back,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;The creature
in my bedroom, the creature that tried to
murder me and that left a candle burning at my
head and a crucifix on my chest, was not Florence.
No, this creature was Julien De Medici. A crafty
and insatiable maniac engaged in fooling himself.
God, what a notion! Yet if there is another self
to me, how easy and natural. This becomes almost
too ludicrous to be mania. But why not? A
heroic effort to establish an alibi in my own eyes.
Rather clever, in a way. I see visions. I see the
lady of the dagger. And I attack myself somewhat
carefully but convincingly. And as a result
I stand exonerated. It was not I who killed Ballau
but this creature who tried the thing on me.
Clever, yes. But twisted and absurd. But not
if I am mad. That is, completely and intricately
mad. Not if my sanity is a pose which I cunningly
loan myself. But the letter from Rollo.
Then I sent that to myself, too. Yet there was a
postmark. Who saw the postmark? I or the
doctor? I forget this point.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>The smile on De Medici&rsquo;s long face weakened.
His thin fingers moved dreamily over his cheek.
In the silence of the cab his musings resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she knows it was I. And what she has
done has been for my sake ... to protect me.
There must be more to this than I have been able
to remember. The night I called for her at the
theater, the night it happened.... There must
be innumerable things to remember. But I remember
nothing. I can&rsquo;t begin to understand, and I
want to laugh. Yes, my reasoning arouses
laughter in me. If I laugh it would mean, of
course, that I am mad. Or, perhaps it would mean
that I am sane. God knows! There is only one
thing definite. Florence did not visit my room
last night. Yes, and another thing. The phantoms
still crawl around in me. My first emotion
when I saw her at the train was again the sentence,
&lsquo;I am guilty.&rsquo; It sprang to life once more
as it had the moment I leaned over the body....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>The cab was stopping. De Medici sighed and
opened the door. Furtively his eyes watched the
half animate girl as Dr. Lytton helped her from
the cab. She appeared indifferent to the situation.
De Medici, overcome with anguish at the
sight of her pallor and listlessness, took her hand
and pressed its cold fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;is there anything I
can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her dark eyes opened full on his face and an
incredible intuition passed through him. She was
acting! Her collapse, her manner, was entirely a
pretense. Dr. Lytton returned from the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, hurry. We&rsquo;ll have to take care of her
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the apartment the doctor became somewhat
officious. He appeared to be treasuring d&eacute;nouements,
his manner toward De Medici growing
condescending. De Medici, inwardly confused
and victim again of the elaborate fears which had
darkened his days since the murder of his friend,
stood quietly against the wine-colored curtains
and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever he has found out,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;is
valueless or at least of no value as a finale. For
there is still the dagger lady who visited me last
night to explain away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled cautiously, convinced anew that this
creature was no more than a phantom evolved as
an alibi by his own cunning madness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, I never felt more normal in my life,&rdquo; he
murmured to himself, &ldquo;unless my madness or
hallucinations are able to create a sense of normality
in me. If I was mad last night, when the
thing happened, then it is obvious that I am mad
at this moment. For I am conscious of no different
sense or state of mind. And it becomes obvious
that I have been thoroughly mad ever since
I can remember, and that what I consider my
normality has been no more than a cunning pose
with which I deceived myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton turned to him. He had removed the
girl&rsquo;s wraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have to put her in bed,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s had a hard day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded. His eyes avoided Florence
now. The scientist spoke softly to the girl and,
nodding her head listlessly, she arose. Dr. Lytton
led her toward the bedroom. Left alone, De
Medici stood contemplating the long folds of the
curtains. He felt tired, and an inclination toward
self-pity brought tears close to his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be easy to drop the whole thing and
announce myself as mad,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;easy
and almost desirable. As it is&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll hear all
about it in a few minutes. Florence, though ...
she acts. Her manner is too perfect.... The
Bandoux woman ... yes, what about her?...&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned vacuously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given her some powders,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton
announced, reappearing. &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;ll be asleep
soon. And, good Lord, she needs it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; De Medici answered, &ldquo;she looks all
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His attitude toward the scientist had become
wary and amused. He had intended blurting out
to the man the mystery of the night. Instead, he
treasured the fact in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I announce that,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll at once
suspect me. The phantom theory will occur to
him. A ruse, an alibi.... Yes, he&rsquo;s been suspicious
of me from the first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici shuddered. Another idea had opened
in his mind. He recalled his theorizings during
the auction, his wrestling with the psychology of
a criminal. Would a criminal return to the scene
of his crime? Would the sense of insecurity lead
him there, or the sense of morbidity? He remembered
with a chill how cleverly he had debated
the thing with himself, arguing the points pro and
con.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious phenomenon,&rdquo; he mused coolly, &ldquo;it
was I returning to the scene of my crime. And yet
I seemed to be arguing aloofly....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the impulse to laugh seized him. The
absurdity of his self-suspicion almost overcame
him. He controlled his features and nodded
calmly at his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Dr. Lytton had seated himself and lighted a
cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I can tell you the story
now. We have to deal, as I surmised from the
first, with a most fascinating case of dissociation,
commonly called dual personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici smiled. Then it was Florence, and
the doctor had proved her guilt. Obtained a confession,
his telegram had announced. The man,
for all his cleverness, was an ass. He had managed
to bungle everything as idiotically as had
Norton. But as he stood, aware that he was sneering
at his friend, a new twist entered his thought.</p>
<p>As the doctor started talking, the idea had
flashed through De Medici&rsquo;s mind.... &ldquo;Quite
right. Florence. It might have been she. And
the creature with the dagger last night might have
been I. Innocent of Ballau&rsquo;s murder, constant
fear of my possible guilt may have resulted in the
creation of the dagger phantom as an alibi&mdash;an
unnecessary alibi.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton, supremely satisfied with himself
and oblivious to the changes of expression in his
friend&rsquo;s manner, was proceeding in the professorial
manner he assumed when expounding indisputable
truths and unalterable facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to point out to you first,&rdquo; he announced,
&ldquo;the fact that the obvious, although frequently
open to doubt, is nevertheless not to be
dismissed. It is a common fallacy of people engaged
in the solution of mysteries or more scientific
problems to flout the obvious and to search
for the secret in things hidden from the cursory
eye. It was this fact which led us somewhat
astray for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in no mood for a Freshman lecture on
psychology,&rdquo; De Medici interrupted calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the thing in my own way,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; De Medici shrugged his shoulders.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll listen to what is pertinent and ignore
the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can listen or not as you please, my dear
Julien. But I advise you first to relax. You look
as white as a ghost, and have been standing there
for almost fifteen minutes talking to yourself like
a lunatic. There&rsquo;s nothing to be gained by experimenting
with your nerves. I&rsquo;ve told you that
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went to Rollo,&rdquo; De Medici murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; the doctor laughed. &ldquo;I went to
Rollo, Maine. And I&rsquo;ll pass over the various details
that led me to the conclusion that Floria was
to be found in Rollo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived there around three in the morning,&rdquo;
the doctor continued unperturbed. &ldquo;An abominable
place. One rustic hotel. And it was closed.
While you were sleeping peacefully in your bed,
my dear Julien, I was parading the dark, chill
streets of Rollo, Maine, in quest of comfort, clews
and companionship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I slept comfortably in my bed,&rdquo; smiled
De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Dr. Lytton asked abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Go on. You are in Rollo. The
streets are dark and chill. And you search for
clews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. You are prepared to flout my story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening, Hugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I go on, Julien, I must impress one
thing on you. Prejudice is a poor guide for deduction.
If you are in love with poor Florence you
will be helping her more by facing the facts
squarely....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My emotions are in abeyance, Hugo. I listen
only as a Dr. Watson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I will first indulge in a modest
preamble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A short one would be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Facetiousness,&rdquo; smiled Dr. Lytton, &ldquo;is a good
outlet for nerves. I make no claim to any sort of
intelligence on my part for what happened during
the dawn in Rollo. Accident is very often the determining
factor in philosophical as well as scientific
discoveries.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had come to Rollo to find Floria, and as I
was walking the streets with no place to go or sit
down I found her. I saw her at the end of the
block hurrying toward me. Her face was pale,
her hair was in disorder, and her eyes were wide
and staring. It was Florence Ballau. She passed
me without any sign of recognition, and I realized
at once from the obvious physical symptoms
she presented that she was in a pathologic state.
I followed her. She walked through the streets
without purpose or destination, moving swiftly
and blindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After an hour, or what seemed an hour, I
caught up with her and took her arm. She looked
at me and said nothing. Now there is one principle
in pathology which is elemental. In talking
to a dual personality it is a waste of energy to
address the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; person. Thus, it is futile to
waste one&rsquo;s breath trying to convince a man who
fancies himself the king of Siam that he is not
the king of Siam. Because when addressing the
victim of such an hallucination, one is addressing
not the victim, but the hallucination. Do you follow
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded. His mind had grown violently
active. The scientist&rsquo;s words died in his
ears, as more and more he gave himself desperately
to the unraveling of a new and astounding
theory that had entered his thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Dr. Lytton, &ldquo;knowing this,
I took her arm. She looked at me. I said to her,
&lsquo;Good morning, Floria.&rsquo; The ruse worked instantly.
Her eyes lighted and a look of complete
recognition came to them. She stood regarding
me excitedly for a moment and then collapsed in
my arms. The village drugstore was just opening
and I carried her inside. After the druggist
and I had revived her I led her to the hotel and
got a room. We sat down and began to talk. I
had the advantage. I knew exactly the pathologic
state with which I was dealing. I said to her: &lsquo;It
is useless to conceal anything, Miss Ballau. I
don&rsquo;t know how you managed to escape from the
police. It may be that they liberated you on their
own account.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was very possible, considering their tendencies
to commit blunders. Then I asked her if
she were able to follow what I was saying. I saw
at once that she was not a distinct dissociation
case, that her dual personalities were not ignorant
of each other, as is frequently found in some of
the more pronounced cases that have come under
my observation. It was obvious also that Floria
and Florence Ballau were gradually merging into
a single personality with the result that the young
woman, instead of suffering from periodic and
isolated attacks of what we may call insanity,
attacks which after their conclusion left her the
normal Florence Ballau we knew, was now become
a single disordered brain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;The air-tight compartments in which each of
her personalities had their separate being had
broken. The result was this distracted semi-maniacal
young woman who had fled from the
police station to Rollo to hide. I explained all this
to her and she was able to follow me in part. It
was necessary to explain the thing, first, in order
to give her a momentary consciousness, that is, a
perspective, and, secondly, in order to assure her
that craft and concealment were futile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when I had finished she took up the story
and cleared away several of the details which had
bothered me. Her confession was extremely interesting
from a scientific point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She confessed the murder?&rdquo; De Medici murmured.
&ldquo;Saying she remembered it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>&ldquo;In due time, Julien. Before reaching the murder,
and in order to understand it, we must establish
the scientific motive. As the morning progressed
Florence, or Floria, grew calm and extremely
docile. I placed the entire conversation
on a scientific basis, a ruse which invariably disarms
criminals of her type. For instance, I asked
her if she knew when she had experienced the
shock which had caused the dissociation or duality
of ego. She told me the thing had happened
or must have happened when she was quite a child.
This, as you know, is frequently the case. Victor
Ballau had once tried to kill her father, a man
named Bandoux. Poor Ballau was in love with
Bandoux&rsquo;s wife. And Bandoux&rsquo;s wife was her
mother. Ballau had conceived a desperate passion
for the woman. Failing somehow to kill the
man, he concentrated his jealousy on the wife. In
the child&rsquo;s mind there came the realization that
this Ballau was at the time causing her mother,
whom she idolized, trouble and anguish. She told
me that she remembers one night seeing her
mother lying on the floor of a room and sobbing.
Ballau had reviled and struck her in a jealous
rage. Florence remembered also that her mother
had cried out on the night she died that she would
be avenged. The child was perhaps only three or
four years old at the time, but the scene was sufficient
to produce the shock which later brought the
duality on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now consider this. As a child she had always
called her mother Floria. Her mother died when
she was four. Ballau carried the child off and
brought her to America. As she grew older the
shock experienced in her childhood began to show
results. The hallucination that she was her
mother began to grow in her and this hallucination
finally became so strong that it was able to
overpower her normal self and she became Floria.
Yes, Floria, the avenging mother whose life Ballau
had ruined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for the murder,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton smiled with
an air of discussing trifles, &ldquo;you recall, Julien,
that poor Ballau seemed nervous about the engagement.
You mentioned things&mdash;suspicions&mdash;to
me. Well, nervous he was. Ballau called her
up that night with a very simple message. He
wanted to tell her something in relation to the
party he was giving. And he was also worried
about her. He had noticed symptoms&mdash;telltale
symptoms of her recurrent mania that day. The
sound of his voice over the phone stirred her subconscious
mind and brought uppermost the Floria
complex. Recall, she said: &lsquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;immediately.
Oh, God!&rsquo; She was merely talking as
Floria. She left the theater and hurried to the
apartment, determined on the vengeance that the
Floria who lived in her was continually demanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, the housekeeper, let her in. I&rsquo;ll return
to this in a moment. She faced her stepfather in
the library. He looked at her and knew what had
happened. This was no longer Florence Ballau,
but the maniac who thought herself Floria, the
lady of the dagger shrieking for vengeance. Poor
Ballau knew this creature. He had struggled with
her before. It was the secret that he held from
the world. We must picture what followed ourselves.
Miss Ballau doesn&rsquo;t remember. Up to
this point I have quoted her confession. From
here on we reconstruct the scene of the murder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see how simple it all grows, Julien?
Floria, the lady of the dagger, killed Ballau. She
remembers dimly, she says, of striking him with
a dagger. She remembers nothing after that for
several minutes. Her normality gradually returned.
But not entirely. She was able to realize
the crime that had been committed, but she was
not able to return to Florence Ballau. I neglected,
by the way, to say that the purse you found was
the property of her mother. And the dress as
well. Both items which her maniac self treasured
as souvenirs. And when she entered the apartment
that night her first impulse was to dress as
her mother&mdash;in these things that had belonged to
the woman. Do you follow me so far, Julien?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici sighed again. The doctor&rsquo;s words
had continued to buzz harmlessly in his ears. His
narrow eyes were glancing furtively at the horizontal
pattern of the wine-colored drapes. The
confusion which had come to him an hour before
appeared to have lifted. Through his thought
drifted the words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One chance. One chance it wasn&rsquo;t I. All this
convinces me. Yes, everything he says points to
me, inasmuch as it completely exonerates her.
But there&rsquo;s still one chance....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>The doctor&rsquo;s question wakened him to the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I follow you ... entirely,
Hugo. Go on. There are a few more details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case of stubborn prejudice that surprises
me&mdash;in you, Julien,&rdquo; the scientist remonstrated
quietly. &ldquo;For the sake of an emotional conviction
you choose to ignore utterly the logic of the
thing. The confession. The dovetailing of every
bit of evidence. It doesn&rsquo;t require much imagination
to see Florence Ballau, alias Floria, preparing
the camouflaged room after the killing.
The cunning instincts of a half-maniac&mdash;to divert
suspicion from herself. In fact, she remembers
finding the beard in an old trunk&mdash;in the trunk
which contained her mother&rsquo;s effects. A beautifully
conceived impulse, her first one, that of glueing
the Vandyke to his chin. But ruined by her
indecision. For after she had placed it there, the
strange look of the man bewildered her and she
tore it off and forced it into his fingers. She reasoned,
as she did so, that if he held the false beard
in his hand it would appear as if he had torn it
from someone else&rsquo;s face&mdash;and therefore seem as
if he had been attacked by a disguised man. But
her first impulse was infinitely better. I mention
it merely as one of those little things which always
rise to prove the superiority of intuition over
reason. The beard pasted on his face would have
been a successful mist over the crime. Consistent,
impenetrable and so on. But the beard torn
from his face was too obvious a clew. It confused
Norton and us, but even without Miss Ballau&rsquo;s
confession it would have eventually given us the
correct lead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sound a bit unconvinced on that point,&rdquo;
De Medici murmured in an abstracted voice, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll let it go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; growled Dr. Lytton, &ldquo;thanks. But the
final proof comes now. I return to Jane, the
housekeeper. In her youth Jane was a close
friend of the mother. Jane is a simple-minded
woman and her sympathies were entirely with
Florence. She, too, remembered the abuse that
Victor Ballau heaped on her mother, and in her
own simple way understood the mania that operated
the thoughts of the daughter. After the
murder Jane helped Florence prepare the scene,
dispose of the evidence&mdash;you remember the
clumsy attempt at concealing the dress on the fire
escape. Also the incident of Florence directing
the attention of the police to the fire escape. You
told me this yourself. This little point itself
shows that there were two minds that camouflaged
the scene&mdash;that Florence was unaware Jane had
hidden the dress outside the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; concluded Dr. Lytton, &ldquo;you have the
crime in full as Miss Ballau confessed it, as I unraveled
it and as I wrote it down, and as she
signed it before we got on the train at Rollo this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the note from Rollo, Maine, signed by the
lady of the dagger while Florence was in New
York in jail?&rdquo; inquired De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will find out that she gave it to someone
to mail,&rdquo; smiled the doctor. &ldquo;A part of the crude
cunning which characterizes her Floria nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my visitor last night?&rdquo; murmured De
Medici.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What visitor?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A curious one,&rdquo; smiled De Medici. &ldquo;A visitor
that has stood beside you laughing in silence at
your words, dear Hugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientist stared at his friend. De Medici
had risen. His face was flushed and his eyes were
gleaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing unravels itself in my head,&rdquo; he continued,
his voice grown tense. &ldquo;Yes, dear Hugo,
a melodrama. Crude, preposterous, but easily
proved. And simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you doubt her guilt?&rdquo; Dr.
Lytton snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I know who killed Ballau,&rdquo; De Medici
answered. &ldquo;Yes, not Florence. And not your
good friend Julien. And not the phantoms either.
But someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici nodded. His brows were contracted.
When he spoke again it was in a meditative tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The commonplace, Hugo,&rdquo; he said softly,
&ldquo;how easily one overlooks it. Little questions
that a child might ask. For instance, what an
awful lot of work it must have been for a single
woman to take care of ten rooms alone. One can&rsquo;t
help but feel a curious admiration for the diligence
and energy of Jane, the housekeeper. Wait
a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed his finger commandingly at the scientist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit still. I want to show you a little drama I
have written while you talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici moved swiftly to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Park View 0146,&rdquo; he spoke into the mouthpiece.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton glared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad,&rdquo; whispered the scientist. De Medici
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly into the telephone.
&ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pause and he continued: &ldquo;Jane, this is Mr.
De Medici calling. Miss Ballau is very ill at my
apartment. We have the doctor here. She is
dying. She told me to telephone you at once. She
says she must see you, that you must come over
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>De Medici listened. No sound came from the
other end of the wire. And then a scream drifted
out of the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Come
over at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited a few moments for a sound. But
the receiver remained silent against his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he murmured. He hung up and
turned to the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am at the present moment unable to decide,
Hugo, which of you is entitled to the credit of
being the world&rsquo;s greatest blundering idiot, you
or Lieutenant Norton. But possibly it may turn
out to be I. So we&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seated himself calmly and, his face grown
imperturbable, lighted a cigarette and stared at
the indignant scientist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The burning-eyed visitor&mdash;An old favorite&mdash;Amateur
theatricals&mdash;&ldquo;Light the candles!&rdquo;&mdash;In which Julien
De Medici reveals himself as an effective playwright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They had been sitting for fifteen minutes in
silence. De Medici finally spoke. He had grown
nervous and catlike, his eyes furtively caressing
the curtains of the room, his ears strained for
sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should be here now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
fifteen minutes&rsquo; walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton grunted and said nothing. A savage
light was in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure Florence will sleep?&rdquo; De Medici
pursued.</p>
<p>The doctor disdained answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s been unfair of me,&rdquo; De Medici
smiled tiredly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been holding something
from you. A woman entered my bedroom last
night just about the time you captured your
Floria in Rollo&mdash;and tried to kill me. She caught
me in the arm with a dagger. I fainted, and when
I awoke I found a crucifix on my chest and a candle
burning at my head.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>The scientist&rsquo;s eyes widened. He nodded as if
weighing this evidence and then remarked curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only say, Julien, that you&rsquo;ve gone mad.
You&rsquo;ve been the victim of hallucinations. The
Floria image has been in your mind so long and
so vividly that it finally materialized into an optical
illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a wound&mdash;and blood,&rdquo; muttered
De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A self-inflicted attack,&rdquo; Dr. Lytton answered
curtly. &ldquo;How long are you going to wait for this
visitor of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici had given instructions to his man,
Harding, to admit any caller without hesitation.
Listening to the doctor, he stiffened. He had
heard an outer door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>There was a long pause. Dr. Lytton followed
the fixed gaze of his friend, and both men sat
watching the door that opened into the curtained
room. Slowly De Medici rose. The door was
opening.</p>
<p>A tall, burning-eyed creature in a preposterous
dress that dropped a silken train behind her
stood on the threshold. Dr. Lytton had moved
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; De Medici whispered, seizing his arm.
&ldquo;Here is Floria.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The woman was advancing slowly into the room.
It was Jane, the housekeeper, in a masquerade.
Her eyes were alive with mania. The hollow
cheeks were crazily rouged. The awkward body
and the skinny hands had become curiously graceful.
Behind the crazed make-believe of the creature
loomed a startling personality. Pride, terror
and strength mingled in the flashing, charcoaled
eyes. She continued to move gracefully toward
the two men. In the center of the room she paused.
Looking about her, she spoke in a vibrant, throaty
voice that shot a thrill through her two intent
listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I conjure you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;save him. I have
come to you with my heart in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes slowly focused upon De Medici. He
was standing in front of her, regarding her with
a puzzled attentiveness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will save him, Baron. You must. You
alone can do that. See how I have humbled myself
and come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici&rsquo;s face lighted. He became suddenly
alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, doctor. In the kitchen,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Bring some plates and a bottle. Put them on
the table here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton, his previous indignation vanished,
slipped from the room. A vague and exciting
understanding had come to him. De Medici
cleared the table hastily and lighted the candlesticks.
As he did, his fingers snapped the electric
switch and the room dropped into a yellow shadowed
darkness. Dr. Lytton returned with his
arms loaded.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p06.jpg" alt="{uncaptioned}" width="500" height="704" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>&ldquo;Set the table as if for a meal,&rdquo; murmured De
Medici, his eyes holding the stare of the woman,
&ldquo;and bring a knife. A long knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman, oblivious to these maneuvers, had
begun to talk once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name your price, then, Baron,&rdquo; she intoned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; De Medici whispered to the scientist,
&ldquo;and leave the rest to me. I&rsquo;ll take the part. I
know it well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the woman, his figure become polite,
leering, his hand extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Lady Floria,&rdquo; he smiled at her, &ldquo;venal
my enemies call me. But remember, I do not sell
myself for money. If I must betray my honor&rdquo;&mdash;he
paused to laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I insist upon choosing my
payment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He advanced toward the woman, his manner
becoming unctuous and caressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have scorned and braved me, Lady
Floria,&rdquo; he spoke, &ldquo;yet your beauty has kept me
enslaved. I&rsquo;ve watched you clinging to your lover
like an amorous tigress and I vowed that you
would be mine some day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>He paused and waited. The woman&rsquo;s eyes had
taken fire. Her head flung itself back in a superb
gesture. Her voice came throatily and distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I would rather kill myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant De Medici beamed with delight.
Then again the unctuous, leering manner returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you forget I hold your
Mario&rsquo;s life in pawn for yours, Tosca.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded regally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think, Baron Scarpia, that I would
contract so hideous a payment with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici, in search of his lines for a moment,
hesitated and then cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you detest me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tosca facing him laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;with my soul and body
I loathe you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, &rsquo;tis thus I love you most,&rdquo; he spoke.</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton, eyeing the incredible make-believe
for a moment, had become busy. The drift of the
strange scene had penetrated his thought. His
hands had cleared the table and arranged the
plates and bottles brought from the kitchen.
Carefully he laid the knife on the edge nearest the
woman. De Medici, seizing the swing of the lines
he had evidently once known, fired the antiquated
Sardou speech at the woman, remembering and
improvising as he went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>&ldquo;Spolletta, pay attention.&rdquo; He was addressing
imaginary actors. &ldquo;I have changed my mind.
The lovely Floria and I have made a bargain.
Let Cavaradossi be shot. Here is the order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning to the table he scribbled with a pencil
on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Floria,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the passport. I have
fulfilled my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely,&rdquo; came the voice behind him. &ldquo;I
must have a safe conduct enabling me, too, to quit
the country. For I go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After tonight?&rdquo; De Medici murmured, &ldquo;you
will leave me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice behind him answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton was watching narrowly. He saw
the metamorphosed housekeeper stealthily approaching
the apparently unconscious De Medici.
With infinite caution her fingers reached for
the knife on the table edge. She held it behind
her as De Medici raised a wineglass in his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my lovely one, my beautiful Tosca, at last
thou art mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the woman appeared to become
transfigured. The terror of her eyes gave way to
an exultant light. She stood poised for a moment,
gazing at the man straightening with the
wineglass in his hand. Then with a cry she raised
the knife and plunged it toward De Medici.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>He had been waiting, his body tensed for the
moment. His hand caught the descending arm
and frustrated the attack. But immediately he
sank to the floor, crying hoarsely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me, help me, I am dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lytton, who had followed the grewsome
pantomime, stood motionless against the curtains.
The woman approached the figure spread on the
floor and remained looking down into the face of
the man she had slain. Then, without removing
her eyes from him, she went through the motions
of washing her fingers in one of the water glasses.
She stopped, and her gaze centered on the two
lighted candles. A shudder passed through her.</p>
<p>De Medici, warily alert, watched her lift the two
candlesticks from the table and lean over him.
For a moment the face of the madwoman breathed
against him as the candlesticks were placed one
at each side of his head. She had kneeled. Tearing
the crucifix that hung from her neck, she laid
it upon his chest and then arose.</p>
<p>Actress and murderess had become merged in
her eyes. She glanced wildly about the darkened
and shadow-dancing room and then, with a last
look at the figure on the floor, moved toward the
door. She walked like one in a dreadful dream,
her body moving as if impelled by a force.</p>
<p>De Medici, still motionless, waited till she had
retreated several steps. Raising himself, he
whispered quickly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her get away, Hugo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the woman had paused before Dr. Lytton
could move. Her figure grew larger in the shadows.
Her gaze had torn itself from the one on the
floor. She was staring straight ahead of her.
Standing in the doorway blocking her path was
Florence Ballau.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s hair was down and a drowsy look
was over her eyes. She stood regarding the woman
in the trailing gown and then, raising her arms,
stumbled forward with the cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother ... mother.... Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>

<blockquote>
<p>In which Florence takes up the drama&mdash;A taxicab, as
in the beginning&mdash;In which what is left of the reader&rsquo;s
suspense and curiosity is carefully removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cab bowled slowly along through the circuitous
park roads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him to take his time,&rdquo; De Medici whispered.
&ldquo;The air will do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the girl beside him. Tenderness
lighted his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s really nothing to worry about any
more, Florence. Your mother will have excellent
care where she is. Dr. Lytton wrote me that he&rsquo;s
taken personal charge of the case and that she&rsquo;s
as happy as anyone could expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence nodded. Her hand took his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been wonderful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And
more than anything else, I admire your reticence.
It&rsquo;s a week&mdash;and you haven&rsquo;t asked me any questions
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And rejoicing
in my own way. There&rsquo;s no hurry for the epilogue.
And anyway ... I prefer this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised her hand and kissed it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to go somewhere and talk,&rdquo; she said
at length. &ldquo;The cab&rsquo;s a bit inconvenient. And
I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Medici yielded the point with a minor protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an obsession in favor of cabs,&rdquo; he
smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always done most of my thinking
in cabs, and most of my business has been transacted
in them. I fancy it&rsquo;s because rooms always
used to depress and frighten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave directions to the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to my place,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;And on
the way I&rsquo;ll tell you about my end of the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the cab turned back De Medici began his
story, confessing for the first time aloud the
strange suspicions that had seized him as he bent
over the body of his friend Ballau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was convinced at the moment,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;that, in a fit of mental aberration during which
I took on some of the characteristics of my
ancestors, I killed poor Victor. And the more
I thought of that, the more guilty I seemed to
feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued relating the fears that had
haunted him, the hallucinations that had accused
him during the ensuing weeks. Florence listened
quietly, her large eyes regarding him with emotion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love you so,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and I knew
there was something like this. And I tried to
utilize it to save her. It was never clear in my
mind just what I was doing ... or just how it
{could work. I must have been acting on}
impulse, determined that whatever happened, she
would be spared. But it&rsquo;s better this way, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the cab and entered De Medici&rsquo;s
apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll like living here,&rdquo; she smiled as they sat
down in the room of the curtains. &ldquo;Providing,
of course, the ghost of Francesca is forever laid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forever,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>She studied him in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;at length&mdash;&ldquo;there is a change. Something
seems absent from your face. A nervousness.
As if....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if,&rdquo; he supplied, &ldquo;the phantoms of De
Medici had said good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if you loved me in a simpler way,&rdquo; she
corrected. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s left now. If
you wish to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some tea?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>He gave instructions to his man. Ten minutes
later they were sitting happily over their emptied
cups.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Florence began, &ldquo;it goes back to long
ago. I remember none of it. But the story is
familiar. Poor father&mdash;I still must call him
father&mdash;told it to me at least a dozen times. It
was in London before I was born. There was a
man named Bandoux, a Frenchman. He and
Victor Ballau were rivals for my mother&rsquo;s love.
Does it sound stilted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rather old-fashioned melodrama,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;Bandoux was a dashing, unscrupulous
sort. And she eloped with him. They were gone
about a year and they came back to London with
me. Bandoux had refused to marry her, even
after I came. In fact, he mistreated, abused and
reviled her every hour of the day. And poor
Victor still loved her. Mother was young and
temperamental and proud, of course. But
finally Victor&rsquo;s love reached her heart. They
were married and lived together happily for a
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Fanny was a little mixed in her dates,&rdquo;
De Medici smiled as she paused, &ldquo;but otherwise
the story is the same&mdash;to that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her briefly of his adventure with the
wardrobe mistress and the candlestick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember her,&rdquo; Florence went on.
&ldquo;Well, father, that is, Victor Ballau, was in
charge of the Goldsmith Theater at that time and
mother was playing the leads in the repertoire
bills they put on. Things were going nicely, and
apparently poor mother had forgotten the hell
she&rsquo;d been through with Bandoux.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then one day father had to leave London on
business, and in his absence the leading man fell
ill. I forget his name. The manager in charge
dashed around frantically in search of some experienced
repertoire man to take his place, and
found&mdash;Bandoux. He&rsquo;d had a hard time of it and
was willing to join the company for anything he
could get. Mother objected violently at first.
But it was either Bandoux or shutting down for
the week, there being no actor available at the
price they could pay for a mid-season employment.
And so mother finally agreed. Bandoux
played in the cast that night. Oh, he was a scoundrel!
Everything that has happened, all the
tragedy that haunted poor Victor Ballau&rsquo;s life,
came from him and his rottenness. The play that
night was Sardou&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tosca.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father has told me all these details. I was
about three years old at the time. But I seem to
remember the creature, a flamboyant type of
cheap actor. With a grand manner and a nasty
temper. Terribly vain of his looks. An unscrupulous
rogue who devoted himself to boasting and
to women.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Bandoux took the part of Baron
Scarpia. Mother played Floria La Tosca. It had
always been one of her favorite r&ocirc;les. The play
went through the first act with nothing unusual
happening. Mother was nervous and excited but
managed to restrain herself. Her loathing of this
man Bandoux was almost too much for her. And
in the second act the thing happened. The grief
he had caused her, the hatred his perfidy had left
in her heart, flamed out. And when the murder
scene arrived, poor mother went out of her head.
She raised the dagger to kill Baron Scarpia as
she had so often done in other performances.
But this time she screamed and hurled herself at
Bandoux. He was almost taken by surprise
but managed to defend himself and escaped
with a slight wound. Mother fainted. There
was pandemonium and the curtain was rung
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father came back the next morning and found
her still raving. She had been taken to a hospital
and was completely out of her mind. She was
Floria La Tosca, screaming the idiotic lines of the
play and going through the pantomime of the
stage murder. For a month she lay completely
insane. Her mildest moments were spent in
weeping. The rest of the time she lay crying out
that she wanted to kill Scarpia, who had betrayed
her. Poor father was beside himself with grief.
Nothing, of course, could be done with Bandoux.
They got rid of him and hushed up the scandal.
The theater was closed and father devoted himself
to her. He was a wonderful man, the finest
man that ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>She paused in her story, her eyes glistening
with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An impression I always had,&rdquo; whispered De
Medici, &ldquo;a man smiling courteously at grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did his best,&rdquo; Florence continued. &ldquo;And
gradually the active mania left her. She became
what we grew to regard as normal. But she was
no longer Florence Ballau. When she got over
her violence she had forgotten who she was, she&rsquo;d
forgotten even that she was father&rsquo;s wife. All
memory of the past had been wiped out. She left
the bed in the hospital one day, quiet once more
and unaware of her name, unaware even that she
was my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father took us both away to a place in the
north of England and we lived there for some
time. He did everything that could be done to
restore her. But it was futile. Apparently she
had recovered from her mania. But she was unable
to return to herself. She developed during
the year in England into a docile, simple-minded
woman&mdash;the woman you knew as Jane. Father&rsquo;s
friends insisted that he put her into an insane
asylum. But he refused indignantly. He tried
for a time to convince her she was his wife. This
fact, however, struck her as preposterous. She
refused to believe it or to have anything to do with
father. And he was afraid of talking too much
to her about it, afraid of bringing on her insanity
again&mdash;I mean the active part of it. The result
was that he finally hit on the plan of convincing
her that she was his housekeeper. This was successful.
She seemed willing to accept the part as
his housekeeper, and he brought us both to America,
giving her another name. And our strange
life with Jane started.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody ever suspected. During the twenty
years we lived in New York father was constantly
devoted to her. She was in his mind his wife, and
despite everything she remained so to the end.
He never ceased to suffer because of the position
she insisted upon occupying, and he frequently
made love to her, trying to persuade her to marry
him instead of her remaining his housekeeper.
But it was odd about poor mother. She would
grow puzzled when he became tender, and then
her excitement would begin. He was frightened
of bringing on the violence&mdash;we called them spells&mdash;and
he would drop the subject. She would go
around for several days murmuring to herself and
looking reproachfully at father, whom she had
grown to regard as a friend and protector. And
if he pressed the matter she would break out with
the words: &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t marry you. Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rsquo;
And she would stand and look at him
with terror in her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>&ldquo;As I grew up I became aware of all this and
of what was going on. Father made no secret of
it. She was my mother. Somehow his quixotic
devotion inspired a similar affection in me. She
was more than a mother&mdash;an unfortunate to be
protected and watched over. Through all the
years of his success and his rise to fame he remained
absolutely faithful to this self-imposed
trust of his. There was never another woman in
his life than the memory of the beautiful actress
that was buried in the simple-minded housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused and looked sadly at De Medici.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for the past,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;Perhaps
you can&rsquo;t understand how a man could be faithful
and as kind as poor father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can,&rdquo; De Medici answered. &ldquo;It is sometimes
easier to love a memory than a woman ...
and easier to be faithful to one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Florence continued, &ldquo;what I&rsquo;ve told
you is only part of it. There were other things
that happened. I&rsquo;ll have to speak of them too
because ... well, because they form the story. I
can hardly talk of them even now. Oh, it was
terrible! There were times when Floria returned,
the same Floria who had screamed for months in
the London hospital. I remember the first time I
saw her. It was about twelve years ago. I came
home from school and found mother, that is Jane,
dressed in a ball gown and talking to father in a
voice I had never heard before. She was playing
the part of La Tosca. When I arrived father was
in tears. We both managed somehow to quiet her
and after an hour she fell asleep. When she woke
up she was Jane again. And there was no memory
in her mind of the scene she&rsquo;d been through.
She worked around for days, looking dully at us
and only half alive. But after this Floria returned
a number of times and each time more and more
violently. We never knew when one of the spells
would come to her and we spent all our time
watching her, trying to anticipate her and soothe
her. But despite all our efforts we could do nothing.
Floria would come and father would at once
begin to act. It was the only way to humor her.
Several times I sat by crying my eyes out and
watching him play Baron Scarpia for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>&ldquo;We tried everything&mdash;remedies, travel, and
even several specialists. But the only thing we
found able to bring her out of her spells, to end
quickly the delusion which would sweep her, was
to let her have her own way for a while. Father
discovered that if he indulged her for a few minutes
and played the part of the Baron, if he let
her dress herself as Tosca, the Floria obsession
would collapse of itself. And particularly if I
were present and watching. Otherwise the delusion
would last for hours&mdash;even days. And all
this kept on through years. Oh, it was awful!
But he would never consider for a moment sending
her away. She was his wife to the last. I&rsquo;ll
tell you about the night ... about the night he was
killed,&rdquo; she concluded for a space with a sigh.</p>
<p>De Medici sat waiting, his hand on hers and his
eyes staring miserably at her saddened face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the night he was killed,&rdquo; she resumed,
&ldquo;the same thing happened that had happened frequently
before. Floria returned. Father, worried
and frightened by the fact that my engagement
party was to take place in a few hours, telephoned
me. He told me briefly over the phone
that she was in one of her spells. I understood.
There was a chance, if he humored her and if I
were present, that we might rid her of the mania
in a short while. I rushed out of the theater beside
myself. To have this thing happen on this
night seemed to me almost too much to bear. I
was beside myself with fear and grief. You know,
when one has guarded a secret so carefully all
one&rsquo;s life, one becomes almost like the secret itself.
I was not ashamed of having it known that Jane
was my mother. But under poor father&rsquo;s influence,
I had all my life worked with him to keep
the secret of her insanity hidden from our world.
And it was as if something beautiful would be
soiled for him more than for me if it were discovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got home in a few minutes. I had a key and
let myself in. Father had set the little scene as he
frequently had done before. He had even put on
the black beard that he wore when he played
Scarpia for her. He had found that these details
served to convince mother of the reality of the
scene and to shorten the awful thing. I ... I
opened the door. He was sitting in a chair with
his back to me as I entered. I saw mother raise
the dagger and strike him, screaming at the same
time. I stood still. I thought for the moment it
was another one of the awful make-believes I&rsquo;d
witnessed so often. And I waited for father to
stand up. He did. He stood up slowly and turned
and saw me and nodded with a smile. The dagger
was in his heart and he stood smiling at me. The
act was over for him, the terrible scene that he had
so often played. It was over forever this time.
And as he fell he snatched at the thing on his chin
and tore it off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<p>&ldquo;I still failed to realize what had happened. He
had smiled so kindly, I could hardly believe it
was anything but a minor accident. But gradually
it came to me. I stood horrified and watched
mother approach the body on the floor and place
the candle at his head and the crucifix on his body.
Then she turned and saw me. I thought of one
thing only. That I must save her. I knew he
would wish it that way. I remembered how he had
looked when he stood before me with the dagger
killing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She walked to me and collapsed in my arms. I
dragged her to the bedroom and removed the costume.
She lay in a heavy sleep for a few minutes.
I washed the rouge from my face. My mind, as
you can imagine, was not entirely clear. I didn&rsquo;t
know what to do with things. I was obsessed only
by the desire to protect her, to save her. And I
must have thrust the ball gown out of the window
on the fire escape. But I didn&rsquo;t remember doing
it when you came. She lay sleeping and I knew
she would sleep for at least ten minutes. I went
into the library and then I must have lost my
head. I had an idea fixed in my mind of misleading
the police with false evidence. All I could
think of was to make it look as if a terrible fight
had taken place. I pulled a lot of books down, cut
a few pictures, and turned over some chairs. I
remember blowing out the candle and seeing the
beard in father&rsquo;s hand. I was going to remove it
but thought it would be better to leave it there
because it would increase the mystery and baffle
the police. I thought, too, that the police would
figure out he&rsquo;d been attacked by a man and had
torn the false beard from his assailant&rsquo;s face. I
didn&rsquo;t think of the gum mucilage that might show
on his own chin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see now, Julien, why I couldn&rsquo;t tell you
anything, why I had to keep still and lie and muddle
things up. It was for his sake. I kept feeling
how he would feel if anything happened to her&mdash;if
exposure overtook her. I was desperate and the
thought that it was you who seemed intent upon
unmasking the thing that we had kept so hidden
for so long drove me wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; De Medici nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I&rsquo;d fixed up the library,&rdquo; Florence continued,
&ldquo;mother awoke. I told her that she&rsquo;d
fainted and she said yes, she knew she was subject
to dizzy spells. She got dressed and went out to
the kitchen to go on with her work and I went
into the library and screamed. She came running
to me and I told her father had been murdered.
She remembered nothing, of course, of what had
happened. I impressed upon her that I had just
come in and found her fainting, but that she
should not tell that to the police because it would
look bad for her; that she should just tell them I
had come in and screamed. You recall the first
story she told. And the time Lieutenant Norton
asked her whether she had seen anybody else in
the apartment and she said yes, she had seen a
man with a black beard, I was standing just outside
the door. For a moment I thought it was all
over and that the lieutenant had hypnotized poor
mother or something and was going to learn the
secret from her. But she evidently recovered herself
and the Floria that almost spoke in the library
that time remained hidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>&ldquo;After the inquest I began to see what was
worrying you, poor Julien. I couldn&rsquo;t understand
at first, but from the way you spoke and acted I
saw that you didn&rsquo;t believe it was I who had done
it and that somehow you accused yourself. Oh,
it was terrible! I didn&rsquo;t know what you might do,
and yet I figured blindly that if I kept still, your
self-suspicions would lead you off the track. Then
I took mother to Rollo. We had been there once
before during a summer. There&rsquo;s a sanitarium
on the outskirts of the village. They knew her
there and the thing she was suffering from. And
I entrusted her to their keeping and hurried back
to New York. I remembered that during several
of her seizures she had written letters to father
and signed them &lsquo;Floria.&rsquo; They were letters
threatening to kill him and addressing him sometimes
by name and sometimes as Baron Scarpia.
Some of them had the picture of a dagger underneath
the name Floria. I meant to destroy them
and I recalled that it was one thing I had forgotten
to do. So I came back and they caught
me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had tried right along to make out I was convinced
father had committed suicide, and I was
hoping the police would believe it. And from the
way they acted at the inquest I felt almost desperately
certain that they did. I knew you had
learned about the telephone call, but I was positive
you would say nothing. Oh, you were so good,
Julien! But when they arrested me and began
their questioning I saw that they hadn&rsquo;t been
fooled. I didn&rsquo;t know what course to take, so I
decided to say nothing. I didn&rsquo;t care what happened
to me. I think I must have gone a little mad
myself. And that night they brought you and that
terrible doctor to the station I was completely
insane. Crazed ideas kept coming into my head.
I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how much you knew, and
when Dr. Lytton started hypnotizing me I pretended
to be in a hypnotic sleep. I was going to
confess to being a double personality. I saw at
once that was what you and he suspected. But
somehow I couldn&rsquo;t. I played with the idea until
I became frantic and then fainted. That wasn&rsquo;t
acting&mdash;the faint,&rdquo; she smiled; &ldquo;that was real.
But it came in handy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then this awful farce started. Lieutenant
Norton decided to release me and did. And I made
for the train at once. I had a feeling that things
were wrong with her. I must have taken the same
train as Dr. Lytton did. It was quite dark when
I got off at Rollo and we didn&rsquo;t see each other. I
made directly for the sanitarium. They admitted
me and the doctor was glad I had come. He told
me that mother had left two days ago and he
didn&rsquo;t know what had become of her. She had
eluded the attendants and vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beside myself and didn&rsquo;t know what to
do. It seemed that all I&rsquo;d been through was now
for nothing. Poor mother was alone, crazed and
wandering. God knew where. And I started
walking distractedly in the street not knowing
what to do first or where to go, when Dr. Lytton
stopped me. When I saw him I felt that it was
all over, that he knew everything. But when he
began to talk to me I noticed at once it was I he
suspected. He thought I was the insane one, the
double ego and all that. And I listened to what he
said. It was easy to take him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she smiled and De Medici found it suddenly
difficult to suppress a laugh. The vision of
the didactic scientist and his arbitrary conclusions,
his subsequent discomfiture and good sportsmanship
in admitting his innumerable errors,
lightened the mood between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night she came here,&rdquo; smiled De Medici,
&ldquo;and I knew, when I saw you beside Dr. Lytton
on his return from Rollo, that he&rsquo;d blundered.
That is, I suspected it. There was another suspicion,
but we&rsquo;ll not discuss that any more.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo; Florence looked tenderly at him.
&ldquo;Dr. Lytton told me. Anyway, after he&rsquo;d talked
to me in the village hotel I improvised a story that
fitted in with his theories. My chief idea was to get
him out of Rollo. I was all to pieces. All I could
think of was that I had to keep him from finding
out about mother at the sanitarium. And when he
wanted me to confess, I confessed. It seemed to
cheer him up a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said De Medici, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a terrible man to
argue with. But the truth dawned on me&mdash;about
her&mdash;as we were coming up here from the train.
It struck me as if it had been something I had
known from the first. Merely that there had been
only one other person in your home at the time he
was killed and that this person had been Jane.
And when I thought this, it all straightened out.
I knew your mother had been an actress. I knew
you were protecting your mother. And I knew she
had killed poor Victor. And knowing all this, it
cleared up suddenly when I thought of Jane.
There was only one thing. The murder ritual ...
out of a play. I surmised that in the next few
minutes while Dr. Lytton was holding forth on
your guilt. I couldn&rsquo;t place the play until I saw
her come in the room. And then La Tosca showed
itself in my head. I had read and witnessed the
thing a score of times and was familiar with most
of the scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>Florence rose and moved to a window. De
Medici, beside her, placed his arm about her
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one mystery left,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>She turned shining eyes to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and this thing in my heart
that makes life incomplete without you.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
